= Results: Simulation studies

1) confirm model picks up known relationships (parameter recovery)
2) confirm code correctness
3) assess overfitting

Note that frequentist methods didn't work well (scam package). (1) very sensitive to one parameter (2) predict extreme values at the ends of x (needs regularisation). Likely an optimisation problem.
