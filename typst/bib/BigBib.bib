  abstract  = {The discovery that the adult mammalian brain creates new neurons from pools of stemlike cells was a breakthrough in neuroscience. Interestingly, this particular new form of structural brain plasticity seems specific to discrete brain regions, and most investigations concern the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampal formation (HF). Overall, two main lines of research have emerged over the last two decades: the first aims to understand the fundamental biological properties of neural stemlike cells (and their progeny) and the integration of the newly born neurons into preexisting networks, while the second focuses on understanding its relevance in brain functioning, which has been more extensively approached in the DG. Here, we propose an overview of the current knowledge on adult neurogenesis and its functional relevance for the adult brain. We first present an analysis of the methodological issues that have hampered progress in this field and describe the main neurogenic sites with their specificities. We will see that despite considerable progress, the levels of anatomic and functional integration of the newly born neurons within the host circuitry have yet to be elucidated. Then the intracellular mechanisms controlling neuronal fate are presented briefly, along with the extrinsic factors that regulate adult neurogenesis. We will see that a growing list of epigenetic factors that display a specificity of action depending on the neurogenic site under consideration has been identified. Finally, we review the progress accomplished in implicating neurogenesis in hippocampal functioning under physiological conditions and in the development of hippocampal-related pathologies such as epilepsy, mood disorders, and addiction. This constitutes a necessary step in promoting the development of therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract    = {A workshop was held on September 13 and 14, 1993, at the GSF, Neuherberg, Germany, to start a discussion of experimental design and statistical analysis issues for three in vivo mutagenicity test systems, the micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow/peripheral blood, the chromosomal aberration tests in mouse bone marrow/differentiating spermatogonia, and the mouse dominant lethal test. The discussion has now come to conclusions which we would like to make generally known. Rather than dwell upon specific statistical tests which could be used for data analysis, serious consideration was given to test design. However, the test design, its power of detecting a given increase of adverse effects and the test statistics are interrelated. Detailed analyses of historical negative control data led to important recommendations for each test system. Concerning the statistical sensitivity parameters, a type I error of 0.05 (one tailed), a type II error of 0.20 and a dose related increase of twice the background (negative control) frequencies were generally adopted. It was recommended that sufficient observations (cells, implants) be planned for each analysis unit (animal) so that at least one adverse outcome (micronucleus, aberrant cell, dead implant) would likely be observed. The treated animal was the smallest unit of analysis allowed. On the basis of these general consideration the sample size was determined for each of the three assays. A minimum of 2000 immature erythrocytes/animal should be scored for micronuclei from each of at least 4 animals in each comparison group in the micronucleus assays. A minimum of 200 cells should be scored for chromosomal aberrations from each of at least 5 animals in each comparison group in the aberration assays. In the dominant lethal test, a minimum of 400 implants (40-50 pregnant females) are required per dose group for each mating period. The analysis unit for the dominant lethal test would be the treated male unless the background frequency of dead implants (DI) is so low that multiple males would need to be integrated to meet the minimum observation of one adverse outcome (DI) per analysis unit. A three-step strategy of data analysis was proposed for the cytogenetic assays. Use of negative historical controls was allowed in certain circumstances for interpretation of results from micronucleus tests and chromosomal aberration tests.},

  abstract  = {Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus leads to the incorporation of thousands of new granule cells into the dentate gyrus every month, but its function remains unclear. Here, we present computational evidence that indicates that adult neurogenesis may make three separate but related contributions to memory formation. First, immature neurons introduce a degree of similarity to memories learned at the same time, a process we refer to as pattern integration. Second, the extended maturation and change in excitability of these neurons make this added similarity a time-dependent effect, supporting the possibility that temporal information is included in new hippocampal memories. Finally, our model suggests that the experience-dependent addition of neurons results in a dentate gyrus network well suited for encoding new memories in familiar contexts while treating novel contexts differently. Taken together, these results indicate that new granule cells may affect hippocampal function in several unique and previously unpredicted ways.},

  abstract  = {The dentate gyrus is one of the few brain structures where new neurons are added throughout adulthood in several mammalian species, including humans. Production of new neurons can be regulated by factors which influence cell proliferation or newborn cell survival. Supplementation or deprivation of glucocorticoids, adrenal hormones involved in the response to stress, affect cell proliferation, leading to a decrease or an increase, respectively, in the number of newborn cells. Glucocorticoid secretion under physiological conditions follows a circadian pattern. We thus investigated a possible relationship between cell proliferation and circadian oscillations of corticosterone secretion in the adult rat dentate gyrus. Corticosterone is the species-specific glucocorticoid hormone of the rat. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was used to evaluate cell proliferation at 4 different time points in the light-dark cycle. No correlation was found between corticosterone circadian oscillations and cell proliferation in the adult dentate gyrus. In contrast, constantly high corticosterone levels, obtained by implanting corticosterone pellets, decreased cell proliferation in particular zones of the dentate gyrus, i.e. the hilus and the superior blade of the granule cell layer. These findings show that a short, physiologically occurring exposure to high corticosterone levels does not influence cell proliferation, whereas a lengthy exposure to this hormone does induce anatomically localized proliferative changes.},

In the present analysis, we evaluated the impact of funding source on publication bias in animal studies estimating the effect of statins on atherosclerosis and bone outcomes.We conducted two independent systematic reviews and meta-analyses identifying animal studies evaluating the effect of statins on reducing the risk of atherosclerosis outcomes (n = 49) and increasing the likelihood of beneficial bone outcomes (n = 45). After stratifying the included studies within each systematic review by funding source, three separate analyses were employed to assess publication bias in these meta-analyses-funnel plots, Egger's Linear Regression, and the Trim and Fill methods.We found potential evidence of publication bias, primarily in non-industry sponsored studies. In all 3 assessments of publication bias, we found evidence of publication bias in non-industry sponsored studies, while in industry-sponsored studies publication bias was not evident in funnel plots and Egger's regression tests. We also found that inadequate reporting of sponsorship in animal studies is still exceedingly common.In meta-analyses assessing the effects of statins on atherosclerosis and bone outcomes in animal studies, we found evidence of publication bias, though small numbers of industry-sponsored studies limit the interpretation of the trim-and-fill results. This publication bias is more prominent in non-industry sponsored studies. Industry and non-industry funded researchers may have different incentives for publication. Industry may have a financial interest to publish all preclinical animal studies to maximize the success of subsequent trials in humans, whereas non-industry funded academics may prefer to publish high impact statistically significant results only. Differences in previously published effect estimates between industry- and non-industry sponsored animal studies may be partially explained by publication bias.},

In this hypothesis, we postulate that a primary deficit in neural stem-cell proliferation; migration, or differentiation, or both, might contribute to net cell loss and neuronal circuit disruption in these disorders. Experimental validation of this hypothesis would not only substantially advance understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, but could also have profound implications for future treatment of these incurable disorders.},

  abstract    = {This paper demonstrates an inflation of the type I error rate that occurs when testing the statistical significance of a continuous risk factor after adjusting for a correlated continuous confounding variable that has been divided into a categorical variable. We used Monte Carlo simulation methods to assess the inflation of the type I error rate when testing the statistical significance of a risk factor after adjusting for a continuous confounding variable that has been divided into categories. We found that the inflation of the type I error rate increases with increasing sample size, as the correlation between the risk factor and the confounding variable increases, and with a decrease in the number of categories into which the confounder is divided. Even when the confounder is divided in a five-level categorical variable, the inflation of the type I error rate remained high when both the sample size and the correlation between the risk factor and the confounder were high.},

  abstract = {The belief remains widespread that medical research studies must have statistical power of at least 80% in order to be scientifically sound, and peer reviewers often question whether power is high enough.\\ This requirement and the methods for meeting it have severe flaws. Notably, the true nature of how sample size influences a study's projected scientific or practical value precludes any meaningful blanket designation of <80% power as "inadequate". In addition, standard calculations are inherently unreliable, and focusing only on power neglects a completed study's most important results: estimates and confidence intervals. Current conventions harm the research process in many ways: promoting misinterpretation of completed studies, eroding scientific integrity, giving reviewers arbitrary power, inhibiting innovation, perverting ethical standards, wasting effort, and wasting money. Medical research would benefit from alternative approaches, including established value of information methods, simple choices based on cost or feasibility that have recently been justified, sensitivity analyses that examine a meaningful array of possible findings, and following previous analogous studies. To promote more rational approaches, research training should cover the issues presented here, peer reviewers should be extremely careful before raising issues of "inadequate" sample size, and reports of completed studies should not discuss power.\\ Common conventions and expectations concerning sample size are deeply flawed, cause serious harm to the research process, and should be replaced by more rational alternatives.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been much interest in using patterns derived from surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization (SELDI) protein mass spectra from serum to differentiate samples from patients both with and without disease. Such patterns have been used without identification of the underlying proteins responsible. However, there are questions as to the stability of this procedure over multiple experiments.We compared SELDI proteomic spectra from serum from three experiments by the same group on separating ovarian cancer from normal tissue. These spectra are available on the web at http://clinicalproteomics.steem.com. In general, the results were not reproducible across experiments. Baseline correction prevents reproduction of the results for two of the experiments. In one experiment, there is evidence of a major shift in protocol mid-experiment which could bias the results. In another, structure in the noise regions of the spectra allows us to distinguish normal from cancer, suggesting that the normals and cancers were processed differently. Sets of features found to discriminate well in one experiment do not generalize to other experiments. Finally, the mass calibration in all three experiments appears suspect. Taken together, these and other concerns suggest that much of the structure uncovered in these experiments could be due to artifacts of sample processing, not to the underlying biology of cancer. We provide some guidelines for design and analysis in experiments like these to ensure better reproducible, biologically meaningfully results.The MATLAB and Perl code used in our analyses is available at http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org},

  Abstract                 = {The removal of outliers to acquire a significant result is a questionable research practice that appears to be commonly used in psychology. In this study, we investigated whether the removal of outliers in psychology papers is related to weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect), a higher prevalence of reporting errors, and smaller sample sizes in these papers compared to papers in the same journals that did not report the exclusion of outliers from the analyses.We retrieved a total of 2667 statistical results of null hypothesis significance tests from 153 articles in main psychology journals, and compared results from articles in which outliers were removed (N = 92) with results from articles that reported no exclusion of outliers (N = 61). We preregistered our hypotheses and methods and analyzed the data at the level of articles. Results show no significant difference between the two types of articles in median p value, sample sizes, or prevalence of all reporting errors, large reporting errors, and reporting errors that concerned the statistical significance. However, we did find a discrepancy between the reported degrees of freedom of t tests and the reported sample size in 41 of articles that did not report removal of any data values. This suggests common failure to report data exclusions (or missingness) in psychological articles.We failed to find that the removal of outliers from the analysis in psychological articles was related to weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect), sample size, or the prevalence of errors. However, our control sample might be contaminated due to nondisclosure of excluded values in articles that did not report exclusion of outliers. Results therefore highlight the importance of more transparent reporting of statistical analyses.},

Our results, on the basis of 281 articles, indicate that around 18\% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15\% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa.

  Abstract                 = {Animal research (AR) findings often do not translate to humans; one potential reason is the poor methodological quality of AR. We aimed to determine this quality of AR reported in critical care journals.All AR published from January to June 2012 in three high-impact critical care journals were reviewed. A case report form and instruction manual with clear definitions were created, based on published recommendations, including the ARRIVE guidelines. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics.Seventy-seven AR publications were reviewed. Our primary outcome (animal strain, sex, and weight or age described) was reported in 52 (68\%; 95\% confidence interval, 56\% to 77\%). Of the 77 publications, 47 (61\%) reported randomization; of these, 3 (6\%) reported allocation concealment, and 1 (2\%) the randomization procedure. Of the 77 publications, 31 (40\%) reported some type of blinding; of these, disease induction (2, 7\%), intervention (7, 23\%), and/or subjective outcomes (17, 55\%) were blinded. A sample size calculation was reported in 4/77 (5\%). Animal numbers were missing in the Methods section in 16 (21\%) publications; when stated, the median was 32 (range 6 to 320; interquartile range, 21 to 70). Extra animals used were mentioned in the Results section in 31 (40\%) publications; this number was unclear in 23 (74\%), and >100 for 12 (16\%). When reporting most outcomes, numbers with denominators were given in 35 (45\%), with no unaccounted numbers in 24 (31\%), and no animals excluded from analysis in 20 (26\%). Most (49, 64\%) studies reported >40, and another 19 (25\%) reported 21 to 40 statistical comparisons. Internal validity limitations were discussed in 7 (9\%), and external validity (to humans) discussed in 71 (92\%), most with no (30, 42\%) or only a vague (9, 13\%) limitation to this external validity mentioned.The reported methodological quality of AR was poor. Unless the quality of AR significantly improves, the practice may be in serious jeopardy of losing public support.},

However, it is not known how the Type-I error may vary under different circumstances, including logistic versus linear regression, different distributions of the confounder, and different categorization methods. Here, we analytically quantified the effect of categorization and then performed a series of 9600 Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the Type-I error inflation associated with categorization of a confounder under different regression scenarios. We show that Type-I error is unacceptably high (>10\% in most scenarios and often 100\%). The only exception was when the variable categorized was a continuous mixture proxy for a genuinely dichotomous latent variable, where both the continuous proxy and the categorized variable are error-ridden proxies for the dichotomous latent variable. As expected, error inflation was also higher with larger sample size, fewer categories, and stronger associations between the confounder and the exposure or outcome. We provide online tools that can help researchers estimate the potential error inflation and understand how serious a problem this is.},

Due to ethical constraints the number of animals used is always reduced where possible. However, as the number of animals decreases so the risk of obtaining inconclusive results increases. By using a more efficient experimental design we can, for a given number of animals, reduce this risk. In this paper two popular cases are considered, where planned comparisons are made to compare treatments back to control and when researchers plan to make all pairwise comparisons. By using theoretical and empirical techniques we show that for studies where all pairwise comparisons are made the traditional balanced design, as suggested in the literature, maximises sensitivity. For studies that involve planned comparisons of the treatment groups back to the control group, which are inherently more sensitive due to the reduced multiple testing burden, the sensitivity is maximised by increasing the number of animals in the control group while decreasing the number in the treated groups.},

  abstract  = {Neural stem and progenitor cells are located in the subependyma of the adult forebrain. An increase in adult subependymal cell proliferation is reported after various kinds of brain injury. We demonstrate an expansion of neural precursor cells in the postnatal subependyma in a murine genetic disease model of Huntington's disease (HD), the R6/2 mouse. We used the in vitro neurosphere assay as an index of the number of neural stem cells in vivo and to assess proliferation kinetics in vitro and in vivo bromodeoxyuridine labeling to assess the progenitor cell population and their fates. Disease progression in this model leads to an increase in the numbers of neural stem cells in the adult striatal subependyma. This increase is produced cell non-autonomously by events in the R6/2 brains as the mice become increasingly symptomatic. Once the neural stem cell increase is induced in vivo, it is maintained during in vitro passaging of neural stem cells, but the neural stem cell increase is not reproduced during in vitro passaging of neural stem cells from presymptomatic R6/2 mice. In addition, we show that some of the R6/2 neural progenitor cells show a change from their normal migration destiny toward the olfactory bulb. Instead, some of these cells migrate into the striatum, one of the main affected areas in HD. Our findings demonstrate that HD damage recruits precursor cells in two ways: expansion of neural stem cells and altered migration of progenitor cells.},

  abstract    = {Heterogeneity can be a major component of meta-analyses and by virtue of that fact warrants investigation. Classic analysis methods, such as meta-regression, are used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. However, it may be difficult to apply such a method in complex cases or in the absence of an a priori hypothesis. This paper presents a graphical method to identify trials, groups of trials or groups of patients that are sources of heterogeneity. The contribution of these trials to the overall result can also be evaluated with this method. Each trial is represented by a dot on a 2D graph. The X-axis represents the contribution of the trial to the overall Cochran Q-test for heterogeneity. The Y-axis represents the influence of the trial, defined as the standardized squared difference between the treatment effects estimated with and without the trial. This approach has been applied to data from the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) comprising 10,850 patients in 65 randomized trials. The graphical method allowed us to identify trials that contributed considerably to the overall heterogeneity and had a strong influence on the overall result. It also provided useful information for the interpretation of heterogeneity in this meta-analysis. The proposed graphical method identifies trials that account for most of the heterogeneity without having to explore all possible sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analyses. This method can also be applied to identify types of patients that explain heterogeneity in the treatment effect.},

Barbering-induced alopecia is a potential symptom of brain impairment and can indicate a stressful environment. We compared alopecia prevalence and severity in mice housed in enriched or standard cages. Providing an enriched environment delayed the onset and reduced the prevalence and overall severity of alopecia in C57BL/6J mice. Husbandry methods that reduce adult alopecia are likely to promote the wellbeing of the animals. We suggest that environmental enrichment is a simple and economic way to reduce alopecia in mouse colonies.},

The NIH mandated enrollment of women in human clinical trials in 1993, but no similar initiatives exist to foster research on female animals. We reviewed sex bias in research on mammals in 10 biological fields for 2009 and their historical precedents. Male bias was evident in 8 disciplines and most prominent in neuroscience, with single-sex studies of male animals outnumbering those of females 5.5 to 1. In the past half-century, male bias in non-human studies has increased while declining in human studies. Studies of both sexes frequently fail to analyze results by sex. Underrepresentation of females in animal models of disease is also commonplace, and our understanding of female biology is compromised by these deficiencies. The majority of articles in several journals are conducted on rats and mice to the exclusion of other useful animal models. The belief that non-human female mammals are intrinsically more variable than males and too troublesome for routine inclusion in research protocols is without foundation. We recommend that when only one sex is studied, this should be indicated in article titles, and that funding agencies favor proposals that investigate both sexes and analyze data by sex.},

We standardized the ORs according to the experimental hypothesis, such that an ROR <1 indicates that nonblinded assessor exaggerated intervention effect, that is, exaggerated benefit in experiments investigating possible benefit or exaggerated harm in experiments investigating possible harm. We pooled RORs with inverse variance random-effects meta-analysis.We included 10 (2,450 animals) experiments in the main meta-analysis. Outcomes were subjective in most experiments. The pooled ROR was 0.41 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.20, 0.82; I(2) = 75\%; P < 0.001), indicating an average exaggeration of the nonblinded ORs by 59\%.

Although such postnatally generated interneurons have been characterized morphologically, their physiological differentiation has not been thoroughly described. Combining retroviral-mediated labeling of newly generated neurons with patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrated that soon after new cells enter the layers of the olfactory bulb, they display voltage-dependent currents typical of more mature neurons. We also show that these "newcomers" express functional GABA and glutamate receptor channels, respond synaptically to stimulation of the olfactory nerve, and may establish both axodendritic and dendrodendritic synaptic contacts within the olfactory bulb. These data provide a basic description of the physiology of newly generated cells in the OB and show that such new cells are functional neurons that synaptically integrate into olfactory bulb circuitry soon after their arrival.},

Only few studies addressed the time course of the natural changes, which are the substrate for interventions that may realize this prospect. We provide a monthly or bimonthly account of cell proliferation, neurogenesis and cell death during the first 9 months of the life of C57Bl/6J mice. Ki67- and DCX-positive cell numbers declined exponentially without an intermittent plateau ( approximately 40\% per month). Cell death in relation to cell proliferation was lowest at 1 month, increased at 2 months to remain constant until 4 months, and decreased again at 5 months to remain stable until 9 months. Granule cell number did not change with age. Our results suggest that manipulations of proliferation and neurogenesis may, at any time, interact with strong natural changes of these processes. Mediators of their age-related decline may be studied over periods much shorter than those typically used.},

The parameters of the algorithm (intensity range and cluster-size) are adjusted for different methods of staining according to expert knowledge. The automatic cell counting method (ACCM) provides correct counting results, as demonstrated by a comparison of computational results with counts gained by human experimenters and with a commercially available image analysis system. On the basis of ACCM counts, small and perhaps physiologically relevant differences in the number of labeled cells can be revealed, as demonstrated here for the GABAergic system following electrical stimulation.},

  abstract    = {Therapeutic success in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has not translated into effective therapy for human ALS, calling into question the utility of such preclinical data for identifying therapeutic agents that are worthy of further study in humans. This random effects meta-analysis of treatment trials in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mouse was undertaken in order to explore possible reasons for this failure of translational research and to identify potential pharmacological interventions that might be used in either a preventative or therapeutic trial in familial ALS. Among studies in which treatment was initiated presymptomatically, the weighted mean differences (WMDs) comparing the active treatment to control treated animals were 12 days (onset), 13 days (survival) and 5 days (survival interval). Among studies in which treatment was initiated at the time of symptom onset, the WMDs were 15 days (survival) and 8 days (survival interval). Subgroup analysis suggests that drugs such as minocycline and Cox-2 inhibitors with an anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, and anti-oxidative agents such as creatine or the manganese porphyrin AEOL-10150, appear to be the most promising for preventative and therapeutic trials respectively in patients with familial ALS. These conclusions should be tempered by the methodological limitations of the relevant literature.},

  Abstract                 = {A recent survey of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Nature revealed that inconsistencies in reported statistics were common. We sought to replicate that survey in the psychiatry literature. We checked the consistency of reported t-test, F-test and chi(2)-test values with their corresponding p-values in the 2005 issues of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry (ANZJP) and compared this with the issues of the ANZJP from 2000, and with a similar journal, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica (APS). A reported p-value was 'inconsistent' if it differed (at its reported number of decimal places) from our calculated p-values (using three different software packages), which we based on the reported test statistic and degrees of freedom. Of the 546 results that we checked, 78 (14.3\%) of the p-values were inconsistent with the corresponding degrees of freedom and test statistic. Similar rates of inconsistency were found in APS and ANZJP, and when comparing the ANZJP between 2000 and 2005. The percentages of articles with at least one inconsistency were 8.5\% for ANZJP 2005, 9.9\% for ANZJP 2000 and 12.1\% for APS. We conclude that inconsistencies in p-values are common and may reflect errors of analysis and rounding, typographic errors or typesetting errors. Suggestions for reducing the occurrence of such inconsistencies are provided.},

Studies with tritiated thymidine, which is incorporated into the DNA of mitotic cells, have revealed that the rodent subventricular zone produces neuroblasts that migrate toward the olfactory bulb along the rostral migratory stream. A similar migratory stream has been documented in monkeys by using the thymidine analogue BrdUrd. The same approach showed that neurogenesis occurred in the dentate gyrus of adult primates, including humans. In the present study, experiments combining injections of BrdUrd and the dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindo-carbocyanine, with the immunostaining for molecular markers of neurogenesis (polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, beta-tubulin-III, collapsin response mediator protein-4, neuronal nuclear protein) in New World (Saimiri sciureus) and Old World (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys have revealed that new neurons are produced in the amygdala, piriform cortex, and adjoining inferior temporal cortex in adult primates. These newborn neurons expressed the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and formed a more-or-less continuous pathway that extended from the tip of the temporal ventricular horn to the deep portion of the temporal lobe. The production of newborn neurons in the amygdala, piriform cortex, and inferior temporal cortex seems to parallel the continuing addition of neurons in the olfactory bulb. These two concomitant phenomena may ensure structural stability and functional plasticity to the primate olfactory system and temporal lobe.},

The most interesting or unusual observations might be regarded as discoveries and therefore particularly worthy of publication. However, the observational process is fraught with inferential land mines, especially if the discoveries are serendipitous. Multiple observations increase the probability of false-positive conclusions and have led to many false and otherwise misleading publications. Statisticians recommend adjustments to final inferences with the goal of reducing the rate of false positives, a strategy that increases the rate of false negatives. Some scientists object to making such adjustments, arguing that it should not be more difficult to determine the validity of a discovery simply because other observations were made. Which tack is right? How does one decide that any particular scientific discovery is real? Unfortunately, there is no panacea, no one-size-fits-all approach. The goal of this commentary is to elucidate the issues and provide recommendations for conducting and reporting results of empirical studies, with emphasis on the problems of multiple comparisons and other types of multiplicities, including what I call "silent multiplicities." Because of the many observations, outcomes, subsets, treatments, etc, that are typically made or addressed in epidemiology and biomarker research, these recommendations may be particularly relevant for such studies. However, the lessons apply quite generally. I consider both frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches.},

One reason is that the focus is on methodology for known multiplicities. Silent multiplicities are much more important and they are insidious. Both frequentists and Bayesians have important contributions to make regarding problems of multiplicities. But neither group has an inside track. Frequentists and Bayesians working together is a promising way of making inroads into this knotty set of problems. Two experiments with identical results may well lead to very different statistical conclusions. So we will never be able to use a software package with default settings to resolve all problems of multiplicities. Every problem has unique aspects.

In this study, an unpredictable chronic mild stress protocol was used to induce a depressive-like phenotype in rats. In the last 2 weeks of stress exposure, animals were treated with the antidepressants fluoxetine, imipramine, CP 156,526 or SSR 1494515, alone or combined with methylazoxymethanol, a cytostatic agent used to arrest neurogenesis. We found that antidepressants retain their therapeutic efficacy in reducing both measured indices of depression-like behavior (learned helplessness and anhedonia), even when neurogenesis is blocked. Instead, our experiments suggest re-establishment of neuronal plasticity (dendritic remodeling and synaptic contacts) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, rather than neurogenesis, as the basis for the restoration of behavioral homeostasis by antidepressants.},

Here we describe that this general assumption is not justified and fails in Huntington's disease (HD). Presymptomatic gene mutation carriers (pHDs) and healthy controls performed worse compared with symptomatic HDs in an auditory signal detection task. During task performance, behavioral data and event-related potentials (ERPs) [i.e., MMN (mismatch negativity), P3a, and RON (reorienting negativity)] were recorded. Not only behavioral performance but also neurophysiological correlates of auditory sensory memory and attentional reorientation indicate enhanced performance occurring primal in late stages of a neurodegenerative disorder. Increased activity of the NMDA-receptor system, an assumed pathogenic mechanism in HD, might facilitate signal propagation at striatal level that enables more efficient task execution through a winner-take-all process. The results challenge the view that late stage neurodegeneration is necessarily related to a global decline in cognitive abilities in HD. In contrast, selectively enhanced cognitive functioning can emerge together with otherwise impaired cognitive functioning.},

  abstract  = {In susceptible individuals, stressors can increase the risk of onset of depression and recent brain imaging studies have shown morphometric alterations in the limbic system of patients affected by depression. The volume loss observed in the hippocampus of depressed individuals suggests a possible involvement of structural neuronal plasticity in the pathogenesis of depression. Stressful conditions in animals can result in impaired structural neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, characterised by retraction of apical dendrites and decreased neurogenesis. The intrinsic dynamic instability of the cytoskeletal microtubular system is essential for neuronal remodelling and plasticity. We have recently shown that both acute and chronic stress decrease microtubular dynamics in the rat hippocampus. Other authors have demonstrated that proteins functionally involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics can be altered by stress in the rodent hippocampus. Furthermore, the existence of a link between stress-induced microtubular changes and depression is further strengthened by evidence showing that both acute and chronic treatment with antidepressant drugs can affect the expression of microtubular proteins. The present review will introduce a growing body of evidence suggesting that stress-induced alterations in neuronal plasticity might be considered the final result of activation and/or inhibition of molecular cascades regulating the dynamics of the microtubular system.

  Abstract                 = {Drug-likeness is a key consideration when selecting compounds during the early stages of drug discovery. However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.},

  abstract  = {Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by a triad of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Although many of these symptoms are likely to be related to central nervous system pathology, others may be due to changes in peripheral tissues. The R6/2 mouse, a transgenic model of HD expressing exon 1 of the human HD gene, develops progressive alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reminiscent of a Cushing-like syndrome. We observed muscular atrophy, reduced bone mineral density, abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance in the mice. All these changes could be consequences of increased glucocorticoid levels. Indeed, hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex and a progressive increase in serum and urine corticosterone levels were found in R6/2 mice. In addition, the intermediate pituitary lobe was markedly enlarged and circulating adreno-corticotrophic hormone (ACTH) increased. Under normal conditions dopamine represses the ACTH expression. In the R6/2 mice, however, the expression of pituitary dopamine D2 receptors was reduced by half, possibly explaining the increase in ACTH. Urinary samples from 82 HD patients and 68 control subjects were analysed for cortisol: in accord with the observations in the R6/2 mice, urinary cortisol increased in parallel with disease progression. This progressive increase in cortisol may contribute to the clinical symptoms, such as muscular wasting, mood changes and some of the cognitive deficits that occur in HD.},

We extend the basic approach to data where there is a relationship between difference and magnitude, both with a simple logarithmic transformation approach and a new, more general, regression approach. We discuss the importance of the repeatability of each method separately and compare an estimate of this to the limits of agreement. We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing. Finally, we describe a nonparametric approach to comparing methods.},

  abstract    = {Focused on interpreting data as statistical evidence, the evidential paradigm uses likelihood ratios to measure the strength of statistical evidence. Under this paradigm, re-examination of accumulating evidence is encouraged because (i) the likelihood ratio, unlike a p-value, is unaffected by the number of examinations and (ii) the probability of observing strong misleading evidence is naturally low, even for study designs that re-examine the data with each new observation. Further, the controllable probabilities of observing misleading and weak evidence provide assurance that the study design is reliable without affecting the strength of statistical evidence in the data. This paper illustrates the ideas and methods associated with using likelihood ratios to measure statistical evidence. It contains a comprehensive introduction to the evidential paradigm, including an overview of how to quantify the probability of observing misleading evidence for various study designs. The University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a classic and still controversial multi-centred clinical trial, is used as an illustrative example. Some of the original UGDP results, and subsequent re-analyses, are presented for comparison purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {Neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus occurs constitutively throughout postnatal life, and the rate of neurogenesis within the DG can be altered under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Adult neurogenesis includes the process in which the division of a precursor cell takes place and the multi-step process (proliferation, differentiation, migration, targeting, and synaptic integration) that ends with the formation of a postmitotic functionally integrated new neuron. During specific time-frames of adult neurogenesis, various markers are expressed that correlate with the differentiation steps along the pathway from early progenitor cells to newly generated postmitotic neurons within the DG. Markers that are currently widely used for the investigation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are: glial fibrillary acidic protein, nestin, Pax6, NeuroD, PSA-NCAM, doublecortin, TUC-4, Tuj-1, and calretinin. The discovery and development of specific markers that allow the time-course and fate of neurons to be followed during adult neurogenesis in a detailed and precise fashion are not only helpful for gaining further insights into the genesis of new neurons in the hippocampus, but also might be applicable to the development of strategies for therapeutic interventions.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

  Abstract                 = {Polysialic acid (PSA) is a linear homopolymer of alpha2-8-N acetylneuraminic acid whose major carrier in vertebrates is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). PSA serves as a potent negative regulator of cell interactions via its unusual biophysical properties. PSA on NCAM is developmentally regulated thus playing a prominent role in different forms of neural plasticity spanning from embryonic to adult nervous system, including axonal growth, outgrowth and fasciculation, cell migration, synaptic plasticity, activity-induced plasticity, neuronal-glial plasticity, embryonic and adult neurogenesis. The cellular distribution, developmental changes and possible function(s) of PSA-NCAM in the central nervous system of mammals here are reviewed, along with recent findings and theories about the relationships between NCAM protein and PSA as well as the role of different polysialyltransferases. Particular attention is focused on postnatal/adult neurogenesis, an issue which has been deeply investigated in the last decade as an example of persisting structural plasticity with potential implications for brain repair strategies. Adult neurogenic sites, although harbouring all subsequent steps of cell differentiation, from stem cell division to cell replacement, do not faithfully recapitulate development. After birth, they undergo morphological and molecular modifications allowing structural plasticity to adapt to the non-permissive environment of the mature nervous tissue, that are paralled by changes in the expression of PSA-NCAM. The use of PSA-NCAM as a marker for exploring differences in structural plasticity and neurogenesis among mammalian species is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {With high-dimensional data, variable-by-variable statistical testing is often used to select variables whose behavior differs across conditions. Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50\%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering-using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative-is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

Using semiquantitative RT-PCR assay, the levels of both BDNF and trkB mRNAs were found to undergo significant variation in a 24-h period. The strongest variation was detected in the hippocampus, where the ratio between maximum and minimum levels was about 3.5 and 17.5 for BDNF and trkB, respectively. These findings provide the first evidence that, in the absence of any experimental manipulation, the expression of a neurotrophin and its receptor undergoes diurnal oscillation, possibly related to the physiological variations of the activity level.},

  Abstract                 = {Most researchers acknowledge an intrinsic hierarchy in the scholarly journals ("journal rank") that they submit their work to, and adjust not only their submission but also their reading strategies accordingly. On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery functions of the current journal system.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Research to address clinical symptoms and the way they change over time in an individual is of paramount importance to healthcare researchers who are interested in improving the quality of life for ill patients. However, typical statistical methods that rely on means can obscure individual trajectories of change. Visual graphical analysis (VGA) is a technique that can provide researchers with an alternative method of quantitative statistical analysis that is more sensitive to individual change and variation. OBJECTIVES: To (a) describe the use of VGA as a method to evaluate longitudinal data, (b) discuss challenges to using this method, and (c) offer recommendations for future research in which the method could be implemented. APPROACH: This methodological article uses data collected from a primary study to present the method of VGA. Daily self-reported sore mouth severity scores from patients receiving outpatient chemotherapy were used in this VGA. The steps of VGA include (a) determining inclusion criteria, (b) managing missing data, (c) creating visual graphs, (d) identifying specific patterns, and (e) performing validation and verification. DISCUSSION: Because symptoms occur differently for each patient, this method allows researchers to see symptom trajectories on an individual basis. Creation and analysis of longitudinal graphs could be used also to inspect other symptoms or clinical problems such as headaches, fatigue, constipation, nausea and vomiting, and psychological difficulties. The value of VGA is that it allows a researcher to study the patterns of an individual's experience, as opposed to averaging all individuals' responses over time. Although graphical analysis is exploratory in nature, it may lead to enhanced longitudinal recognition of symptoms that might not be identified otherwise by quantitative data analysis using summary statistics.},

  abstract  = {During development of the central nervous system, expression of the microtubule binding protein doublecortin (DCX) is associated with migration of neuroblasts. In addition to this developmental role, expression of DCX remains high within certain areas of the adult mammalian brain. These areas, mainly the dentate gyrus and the lateral ventricle wall in conjunction with the rostral migratory stream and olfactory bulb, retain the capacity to generate new neurons into adulthood. Adult neurogenesis is typically detected by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into dividing cells and colabeling of BrdU-positive cells with markers for mature neurons. To elucidate whether DCX could act as an alternative indicator for adult neurogenesis, we investigated the temporal expression pattern of DCX in neurogenic regions of the adult brain. Analysis of newly generated cells showed that DCX is transiently expressed in proliferating progenitor cells and newly generated neuroblasts. As the newly generated cells began expressing mature neuronal markers, DCX immunoreactivity decreased sharply below the level of detection and remained undetectable thereafter. The transient expression pattern of DCX in neuronal committed progenitor cells/neuroblasts indicates that DCX could be developed into a suitable marker for adult neurogenesis and may provide an alternative to BrdU labeling. This assumption is further supported by our observation that the number of DCX-expressing cells in the dentate gyrus was decreased with age according to the reduction of neurogenesis in the aging dentate gyrus previously reported.},

Strain differences in visual acuity accounted for a significant proportion of the variance between strains in measures of learning and memory in the Morris water maze. Strain differences in motor learning performance were not influenced by visual ability. Conditioned odor preference was enhanced in mice with visual defects. These results indicate that visual ability must be accounted for when testing for strain differences in learning and memory in mice because differences in performance in many tasks may be due to visual deficits rather than differences in higher order cognitive functions. These results have significant implications for the search for the neural and genetic basis of learning and memory in mice.},

  abstract    = {Adult rats emit two categories of ultrasonic vocalizations, 22 kHz calls and 50 kHz calls. These vocalizations communicate animal's emotional state to other members of the social group. Production of social vocalizations is an evolutionary old activity in vertebrates, and is regulated by well-preserved brain circuitries. The 22 kHz calls express negative, aversive state and are initiated by activity of the mesolimbic cholinergic system originating from laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. The 50 kHz calls express positive, appetitive state and are initiated by activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system originating from the ventral tegmental area. The 22 kHz calls serve as warning and alarm calls, while the 50 kHz calls serve as affiliative and social-cooperating calls. These specie-specific vocalizations play role of ethological transmitters, termed ethotransmitters, that is, they are species-specific signals that are selectively recognized by receivers and have capability of changing emotional state of the receivers.},

  abstract  = {We propose to furnish visual statistical methods with an inferential framework and protocol, modelled on confirmatory statistical testing. In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of 'discoveries' is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the 'lineup' popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the 'Rorschach' inkblot test, well known from (pop-)psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students' statistical thinking.},

There are also ethical dimensions to this problem, as unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful.

Its soluble secreted form (sAPP) shows similarities with growth factors and increases the in vitro proliferation of embryonic neural stem cells. As neurogenesis is an ongoing process in the adult mammalian brain, we have investigated a role for sAPP in adult neurogenesis. We show that the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle, the largest neurogenic area of the adult brain, is a major sAPP binding site and that binding occurs on progenitor cells expressing the EGF receptor. These EGF-responsive cells can be cultured as neurospheres (NS). In vitro, EGF provokes soluble APP (sAPP) secretion by NS and anti-APP antibodies antagonize the EGF-induced NS proliferation. In vivo, sAPP infusions increase the number of EGF-responsive progenitors through their increased proliferation. Conversely, blocking sAPP secretion or downregulating APP synthesis decreases the proliferation of EGF-responsive cells, which leads to a reduction of the pool of progenitors. These results reveal a new function for sAPP as a regulator of SVZ progenitor proliferation in the adult central nervous system.},

  abstract    = {The dentate gyrus of the rat produces new granule neurons well into adulthood. In the adult, newly born granule neurons migrate from the hilus to the granule cell layer, receive synaptic input, extend axons into the mossy fiber pathway, and express a neuronal marker. No previous studies have identified factors that regulate neuronal birth in the adult dentate gyrus. In order to determine whether glucocorticoids control neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus, the effects of adrenal steroid manipulations on neuronal birth were assessed using [3H]thymidine autoradiography and immunohistochemistry for the neuronal marker neuron specific enolase. Acute treatment with corticosterone produced a significant decrease in the density of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. In contrast, removal of endogenous adrenal steroids stimulated increased neuronal birth; adrenalectomy resulted in a significant increase in the number of neuron specific enolase-immunoreactive [3H]thymidine labeled cells in the granule cell layer compared to sham operation. Replacement of corticosterone to adrenalectomized rats after [3H]thymidine injection did not substantially alter the increase in neurogenesis observed following adrenalectomy, even though this replacement protects cells from adrenalectomy-induced cell death. These results indicate that the rate of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat is dependent upon the levels of circulating adrenal steroids.},

  abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

However, much research does not lead to worthwhile achievements, partly because some studies are done to improve understanding of basic mechanisms that might not have relevance for human health. Additionally, good research ideas often do not yield the anticipated results. As long as the way in which these ideas are prioritised for research is transparent and warranted, these disappointments should not be deemed wasteful; they are simply an inevitable feature of the way science works. However, some sources of waste cannot be justified. In this report, we discuss how avoidable waste can be considered when research priorities are set. We have four recommendations. First, ways to improve the yield from basic research should be investigated. Second, the transparency of processes by which funders prioritise important uncertainties should be increased, making clear how they take account of the needs of potential users of research. Third, investment in additional research should always be preceded by systematic assessment of existing evidence. Fourth, sources of information about research that is in progress should be strengthened and developed and used by researchers. Research funders have primary responsibility for reductions in waste resulting from decisions about what research to do.},

The number and characteristics of reported and unreported trial outcomes were recorded from protocols, journal articles, and a survey of trialists. An outcome was considered incompletely reported if insufficient data were presented in the published articles for meta-analysis. Odds ratios relating the completeness of outcome reporting to statistical significance were calculated for each trial and then pooled to provide an overall estimate of bias. Protocols and published articles were also compared to identify discrepancies in primary outcomes.Completeness of reporting of efficacy and harm outcomes and of statistically significant vs nonsignificant outcomes; consistency between primary outcomes defined in the most recent protocols and those defined in published articles.One hundred two trials with 122 published journal articles and 3736 outcomes were identified. Overall, 50\% of efficacy and 65\% of harm outcomes per trial were incompletely reported. Statistically significant outcomes had a higher odds of being fully reported compared with nonsignificant outcomes for both efficacy (pooled odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.0) and harm (pooled odds ratio, 4.7; 95\% CI, 1.8-12.0) data. In comparing published articles with protocols, 62\% of trials had at least 1 primary outcome that was changed, introduced, or omitted. Eighty-six percent of survey responders (42/49) denied the existence of unreported outcomes despite clear evidence to the contrary.The reporting of trial outcomes is not only frequently incomplete but also biased and inconsistent with protocols. Published articles, as well as reviews that incorporate them, may therefore be unreliable and overestimate the benefits of an intervention. To ensure transparency, planned trials should be registered and protocols should be made publicly available prior to trial completion.},

  Abstract                 = {The reporting of outcomes within published randomized trials has previously been shown to be incomplete, biased and inconsistent with study protocols. We sought to determine whether outcome reporting bias would be present in a cohort of government-funded trials subjected to rigorous peer review.We compared protocols for randomized trials approved for funding by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (formerly the Medical Research Council of Canada) from 1990 to 1998 with subsequent reports of the trials identified in journal publications. Characteristics of reported and unreported outcomes were recorded from the protocols and publications. Incompletely reported outcomes were defined as those with insufficient data provided in publications for inclusion in meta-analyses. An overall odds ratio measuring the association between completeness of reporting and statistical significance was calculated stratified by trial. Finally, primary outcomes specified in trial protocols were compared with those reported in publications.We identified 48 trials with 68 publications and 1402 outcomes. The median number of participants per trial was 299, and 44\% of the trials were published in general medical journals. A median of 31\% (10th-90th percentile range 5\%-67\%) of outcomes measured to assess the efficacy of an intervention (efficacy outcomes) and 59\% (0\%-100\%) of those measured to assess the harm of an intervention (harm outcomes) per trial were incompletely reported. Statistically significant efficacy outcomes had a higher odds than nonsignificant efficacy outcomes of being fully reported (odds ratio 2.7; 95\% confidence interval 1.5-5.0). Primary outcomes differed between protocols and publications for 40\% of the trials.Selective reporting of outcomes frequently occurs in publications of high-quality government-funded trials.},

Here we investigated whether repeated electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), an animal model of ECT, in rats induce neuroplastic changes in the subregions of the hippocampus. ECS or sham treatment was given daily for 10 days to adult male rats. Stereological principles were employed to quantify volumes and the number of neurons and synapses. Volumes of granule cell layer (GCL) and Hilus in Dentate Gyrus of the hippocampus were significantly larger in the ECS treatment group. The neuron numbers in GCL, synapse numbers (including total synapses, spine synapses, and both perforated and nonperforated spine synapse subtypes) and synapse height in CA1 were significantly increased in the ECS treatment group. Our results indicated that repeated ECS induces neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and remodelling of synapses in rat hippocampus. This could provide a potential mechanism to explain the therapeutic effect of ECS.},

  abstract    = {Dichotomizing a continuous variable is known to result in the loss of information, lower statistical power, and lower reliability. In many epidemiological studies, age is a scaled (continuous) variable prior to statistical analyses; however, despite pleas from methodologists, researchers frequently dichotomize age in their data analysis without an appropriate rationale. Using simulated case-control data, we show that dichotomizing age generally will lead to a biased odds ratio (OR). When age was a confounder (potentially representing common causes of risks and outcomes), including age as a scaled variable (whether the age effect was linear or non-linear in the logit), provided satisfactory control, whereas when age was categorized, the estimated risk factor effect was biased. We also demonstrate that the further the cutpoint is from the median age, the greater the increase in the OR; thus, in cases where age dichotomization is warranted, researchers are cautioned not to allow the size of the empirical OR to influence their choice of cutpoint. Recommendations are made for analysing age in epidemiological data and interpretation of empirical findings.},

  abstract  = {In addition to its well-established role in gamma-secretase cleavage, presenilin (PS) also plays a role in regulating the stability of cytosolic beta-catenin, a protein involved in Wnt signaling. Several familial Alzheimer's disease-associated PS1 mutations have been shown to increase the stability of the signaling pool of beta-catenin, correlating with enhanced cell proliferation. Accordingly, we hypothesized that in the setting of PS1 mutations, abnormal activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling leads to increased cell division. We tested this hypothesis by examining whether there is evidence of increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult transgenic mice that overexpress the PS1 A246E mutation. In PS1/PS2-deficient fibroblasts, expression of PS1 A246E Familial AD mutation failed to restore the rapid turnover of beta-catenin compared with wild-type PS1. We then examined whether the same mutation enhanced neurogenesis in vivo in adult hippocampus of PS1-deficient mice when restored by wild-type human PS1 (PS1(-/-)WT) or A246E PS1 mutation (PS1(-/-)AE). The PS1 A246E mutation stimulated the proliferation of progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of adult mice, as assessed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation, but did not influence their survival or differentiation. These observations suggest that the PS1 A246E mutation influences cell growth putatively via abnormal beta-catenin signaling in vivo.},

  abstract    = {Current clinical assessments of motor function in Huntington's Disease (HD) rely on subjective ratings such as the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating scale (UHDRS). The ability to track disease progression using simple, objective, inexpensive, and robust measures would be beneficial.One objective measure of motor performance is hand-tapping. Over the last 14 years we have routinely collected, using a simple device, the number of taps made by the right and left hand over 30 seconds in HD patients attending our NHS clinics.Here we report on a longitudinal cohort of 237 patients, which includes patients at all stages of the disease on a wide range of drug therapies. Hand tapping in these patients declines linearly at a rate of 5.1 taps per year (p < 0.0001; 95\% CI = 3.8 to 6.3 taps), and for each additional year of age patients could perform 0.9 fewer taps (main effect of age: p = 0.0007; 95\% CI = 0.4 to 1.4). Individual trajectories can vary widely around this average rate of decline, and much of this variation could be attributed to CAG repeat length. Genotype information was available for a subset of 151 patients, and for each additional repeat, patients could perform 5.6 fewer taps (p < 0.0001; 95\% CI = 3.3 to 8.0 taps), and progressed at a faster rate of 0.45 fewer taps per year (CAG by time interaction: p = 0.008; 95\% CI = 0.12 to 0.78 taps). In addition, for each unit decrease in Total Functional Capacity (TFC) within individuals, the number of taps decreased by 6.3 (95\% CI = 5.4 to 7.1, p < 0.0001).Hand tapping is a simple, robust, and reliable marker of disease progression. As such, this simple motor task could be a useful tool by which to assess disease progression as well therapies designed to slow it down.},

First, tree diagrams which show the close analogy with the screening test problem. Similar conclusions are drawn by repeated simulations of t-tests. These mimic what is done in real life, which makes the results more persuasive. The simulation method is used also to evaluate the extent to which effect sizes are over-estimated, especially in underpowered experiments. A script is supplied to allow the reader to do simulations themselves, with numbers appropriate for their own work. It is concluded that if you wish to keep your false discovery rate below 5\%, you need to use a three-sigma rule, or to insist on p≤0.001. And never use the word 'significant'.},

In the adult centers, the nerve paths are something fixed, ended, and immutable. Everything may die, nothing may be regenerated. It is for the science of the future to change, if possible, this harsh decree." Similarly, Giulio Bizzozero, the most prominent Italian histologist and mentor of Camillo Golgi, classified the tissues of the human body into "labile, stable and perennial". Among the latter were the nerve cells, believed to be unable to proliferate in the postnatal brain. This classification was taught until a few years ago to generations of medical students and biologists all over the world. We have investigated the historical, methodological and technical reasons why this "central dogma of neurology", so influential in clinical and experimental neurology, has lasted so long. We examined how this dogma was broken and who contributed, and the difficulties encountered by the "heretical" researchers who contributed to this goal, especially between the 1960s and the early 1990s, when at last neurogenesis in the adult brain could no longer be denied. Finally, we propose that the understanding of the mechanisms underlying various neurological diseases and the interpretations of clinical syndromes, as well as the design of new therapies, are being revolutionised by the breaking of this dogma and the discovery of the presence of neural stem cells in the adult brain.},

Doublecortin (DCX) has recently been used as a marker for neurogenesis. However, it was not clear whether DCX could be used to assess modulations occurring in the rate of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian central nervous system following lesioning or stimulatory factors. Using two paradigms increasing neurogenesis levels (physical activity and epileptic seizures), we demonstrate that quantification of DCX-expressing cells allows for an accurate measurement of modulations in the rate of adult neurogenesis. Importantly, we excluded induction of DCX expression during physiological or reactive gliogenesis and excluded also DCX re-expression during regenerative axonal growth. Our data validate DCX as a reliable and specific marker that reflects levels of adult neurogenesis and its modulation. We demonstrate that DCX is a valuable alternative to techniques currently used to measure the levels of neurogenesis. Importantly, in contrast to conventional techniques, analysis of neurogenesis through the detection of DCX does not require in vivo labelling of proliferating cells, thereby opening new avenues for the study of human neurogenesis under normal and pathological conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {At least part of the failure in the transition from experimental to clinical studies in stroke has been attributed to the imprecision introduced by problems in the design of experimental stroke studies. Using a metaepidemiologic approach, we addressed the effect of randomization, blinding, and use of comorbid animals on the estimate of how effectively therapeutic interventions reduce infarct size.Electronic and manual searches were performed to identify meta-analyses that described interventions in experimental stroke. For each meta-analysis thus identified, a reanalysis was conducted to estimate the impact of various quality items on the estimate of efficacy, and these estimates were combined in a meta-meta-analysis to obtain a summary measure of the impact of the various design characteristics.Thirteen meta-analyses that described outcomes in 15,635 animals were included. Studies that included unblinded induction of ischemia reported effect sizes 13.1\% (95\% CI, 26.4\% to 0.2\%) greater than studies that included blinding, and studies that included healthy animals instead of animals with comorbidities overstated the effect size by 11.5\% (95\% CI, 21.2\% to 1.8\%). No significant effect was found for randomization, blinded outcome assessment, or high aggregate CAMARADES quality score.We provide empirical evidence of bias in the design of studies, with studies that included unblinded induction of ischemia or healthy animals overestimating the effectiveness of the intervention. This bias could account for the failure in the transition from bench to bedside of stroke therapies.},

However, the augmentation of neurogenesis in the adult human brain in response to neuronal cell loss has not been demonstrated. This study was undertaken to investigate whether neurogenesis occurs in the subependymal layer (SEL) adjacent to the caudate nucleus in the human brain in response to neurodegeneration of the caudate nucleus in Huntington's disease (HD). Postmortem control and HD human brain tissue were examined by using the cell cycle marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the neuronal marker beta III-tubulin, and the glial cell marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We observed a significant increase in cell proliferation in the SEL in HD compared with control brains. Within the HD group, the degree of cell proliferation increased with pathological severity and increasing CAG repeats in the HD gene. Most importantly, PCNA+ cells were shown to coexpress beta III-tubulin or GFAP, demonstrating the generation of neurons and glial cells in the SEL of the diseased human brain. Our results provide evidence of increased progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the diseased adult human brain and further indicate the regenerative potential of the human brain.},

  abstract  = {The recent demonstration of endogenous stem/progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain raises the exciting possibility that these undifferentiated cells may be able to generate new neurons for cell replacement in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD). Previous studies have shown that neural stem cells in the rodent brain subependymal layer (SEL), adjacent to the caudate nucleus, proliferate and differentiate into neurons and glial cells and that neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus and the SEL of the caudate nucleus in the adult human brain, but no previous study has shown the extent to which progenitor cells are found in the SEL in the normal and diseased human brain with respect to location. From detailed serial section studies we have shown that overall, there is a 2.7-fold increase in the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells in HD (grade 2/3); most notably, the ventral and central regions of the SEL adjacent to the caudate nucleus contained the highest number of proliferating cells and in all areas and regions examined there were more cells in the HD SEL compared with the normal brain. Furthermore, progenitor cells colocalized with betaIII tubulin in a subset of cells in the SEL indicating neurogenesis in the HD brain. There was a 2.6-fold increase in the number of new neurons that were produced in the Huntington's disease SEL compared with the normal SEL; however, the Huntington's disease SEL had many more proliferating progenitor cells; thus, the proportion of new neuron production relative to the number of progenitor cells was approximately the same. This study provides new evidence of the pattern of neurogenesis in the normal and HD brain.},

  abstract  = {Previous studies in the rodent brain have characterised the cell types present in the subependymal layer, however the general organisation and cellular morphology of the adult human subependymal layer has not been demonstrated previously. In this study, we have demonstrated that the normal human brain subependymal layer contains three morphologically distinct types of cells, A, B and C type cells. The type A cells resembling migrating neuroblasts were located in the superficial part of the subependymal layer, type B cells resembling glial cells were evenly distributed throughout the subependymal layer and caudate nucleus, and type C cells that resembled progenitor cells were located in the deeper regions of the subependymal layer close to the caudate nucleus. We also examined the subependymal layer in the Huntington's disease brain to determine whether neurodegenerative pathology of the caudate nucleus (adjacent to the subependymal layer) altered the cellular composition of the subependymal layer. In the Huntington's disease subependymal layer there was a significant increase in the thickness of the subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer (p < 0.01) and there was a 2.8-fold increase in the number of cells present in the Huntington's disease subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer but the density of cells remained unchanged. As the grade of Huntington's disease increased, so did the overall number of cells in the subependymal layer. An increase in the number of type B cells was responsible for most of the increase demonstrated, however there was also an increase in the numbers of type A and C cells. To further characterise the human normal and Huntington's disease subependymal layer we used immunohistochemistry and antibodies against a range of projection neuron markers, interneuron markers, glial cell markers and GABAA receptor subunits. The results demonstrated the presence of increased numbers of neuropeptide Y positive cells in the Huntington's disease subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer, suggesting that neuropeptide Y neurons may play a role in progenitor cell proliferation. Also there was an increased level of the developmentally active GABAA receptor subunit gamma 2 that indicates that the adult subependymal layer still retains the ability to proliferate. Taken together our results give a detailed description of the adult human subependymal layer and also demonstrate the plasticity of the human subependymal layer in response to Huntington's disease.},

Although changes in synaptic plasticity were shown within the hippocampus and striatum of HD transgenic mice, there are no studies considering neocortical synaptic plasticity abnormalities in HD. We examined the impact of the HD transgene upon learning-dependent plasticity of cortical representational maps. The effect of associative learning, in which stimulation of a row of vibrissae was paired with appetitive stimulus, upon functional representations of vibrissae in the barrel cortex, was investigated with 2-deoxyglucose brain mapping in presymptomatic R6/1 HD mice. In wild-type mice, cortical representation of the row of vibrissae involved in the training was expanded, while in HD mice the representation of this row was not expanded. The results suggest that presymptomatic R6/1 HD transgenic mice show deficits in plasticity of primary somatosensory cortex.},

Here we describe a mouse model of an anxiety/depressive-like state induced by chronic corticosterone treatment. Furthermore, chronic antidepressant treatment reversed the behavioral dysfunctions and the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis induced by corticosterone treatment. In corticosterone-treated mice where hippocampal neurogenesis is abolished by X-irradiation, the efficacy of fluoxetine is blocked in some, but not all, behavioral paradigms, suggesting both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms of antidepressant action. Finally, we identified a number of candidate genes, the expression of which is decreased by chronic corticosterone and normalized by chronic fluoxetine treatment selectively in the hypothalamus. Importantly, mice deficient in one of these genes, beta-arrestin 2, displayed a reduced response to fluoxetine in multiple tasks, suggesting that beta-arrestin signaling is necessary for the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine.},

STUDY DESIGN: Cell segmentation was performed by applying global thresholding algorithms to find an approximate threshold at which cells could be separated from background followed by a novel refinement algorithm to erode edge pixels of the region. To separate overlapping cells, a new decomposition method was developed that uses both semantic knowledge and high-level relational information. Both the cell segmentation and separation methods were evaluated on images of stained tissue sections and the manually outlined cell areas and numbers compared to the computed. RESULTS: Macrophage areas computed at the first stage by Otsu's algorithm did not differ significantly (P = .07) from those traced manually, while the areas computed by Kittler's and Kurita's algorithms did not agree (P < .01). Both Otsu's and Kurita's algorithms performed well when combined with edge pixel erosion. Kittler's algorithm proved unsuccessful even with edge erosion. Comparison of the computed and manually determined cell numbers showed a significant correlation, and regression analysis resulted in the unity curve. CONCLUSION: A combination of global thresholding and a novel edge erosion technique allowed identification of immunohistochemically stained macrophages; the computed cell areas agreed with the manual results.},

In this article, we summarize recent progress in this area, including advances based on behavioural studies and insights provided by computational modelling. Increasingly, evidence suggests that newborn neurons might be involved in hippocampal functions that are particularly dependent on the dentate gyrus, such as pattern separation. Furthermore, newborn neurons at different maturation stages may make distinct contributions to learning and memory. In particular, computational studies suggest that, before newborn neurons are fully mature, they might function as a pattern integrator by introducing a degree of similarity to the encoding of events that occur closely in time.},

During neurogenesis, immature DGCs display distinctive physiological characteristics while undergoing morphological maturation before final integration into the neural circuits. The survival and activity of the adult-born DGCs can be influenced by the experience of the animal during a critical period when newborn DGCs are still immature. To assess the temporal importance of adult neurogenesis, we developed a transgenic mouse model that allowed us to transiently reduce the numbers of adult-born DGCs in a temporally regulatable manner. We found that mice with a reduced population of adult-born DGCs at the immature stage were deficient in forming robust, long-term spatial memory and displayed impaired performance in extinction tasks. These results suggest that immature DGCs that undergo maturation make important contributions to learning and memory.},

Huntingtin is normally present in the cytoplasm where it may interact with structural and synaptic elements. The mechanism of HD pathogenesis remains unknown but studies indicate a toxic gain-of-function possibly through aberrant protein interactions. To investigate whether early degenerative changes in HD involve alterations of cytoskeletal and vesicular components, we examined early cellular changes in the frontal cortex of HD presymptomatic (PS), early pathological grade (grade 1) and late-stage (grade 3 and 4) patients as compared to age-matched controls. Morphologic analysis using silver impregnation revealed a progressive decrease in neuronal fiber density and organization in pyramidal cell layers beginning in presymptomatic HD cases. Immunocytochemical analyses for the cytoskeletal markers alpha -tubulin, microtubule-associated protein 2, and phosphorylated neurofilament demonstrated a concomitant loss of staining in early grade cases. Immunoblotting for synaptic proteins revealed a reduction in complexin 2, which was marked in some grade 1 HD cases and significantly reduced in all late stage cases. Interestingly, we demonstrate that two synaptic proteins, dynamin and PACSIN 1, which were unchanged by immunoblotting, showed a striking loss by immunocytochemistry beginning in early stage HD tissue suggesting abnormal distribution of these proteins. We propose that mutant huntingtin affects proteins involved in synaptic function and cytoskeletal integrity before symptoms develop which may influence early disease onset and/or progression.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past decades, great progress has been made in clinical as well as experimental stroke research. Disappointingly, however, hundreds of clinical trials testing neuroprotective agents have failed despite efficacy in experimental models. Recently, several systematic reviews have exposed a number of important deficits in the quality of preclinical stroke research. Many of the issues raised in these reviews are not specific to experimental stroke research, but apply to studies of animal models of disease in general. It is the aim of this article to review some quality-related sources of bias with a particular focus on experimental stroke research. Weaknesses discussed include, among others, low statistical power and hence reproducibility, defects in statistical analysis, lack of blinding and randomization, lack of quality-control mechanisms, deficiencies in reporting, and negative publication bias. Although quantitative evidence for quality problems at present is restricted to preclinical stroke research, to spur discussion and in the hope that they will be exposed to meta-analysis in the near future, I have also included some quality-related sources of bias, which have not been systematically studied. Importantly, these may be also relevant to mechanism-driven basic stroke research. I propose that by a number of rather simple measures reproducibility of experimental results, as well as the step from bench to bedside in stroke research may be made more successful. However, the ultimate proof for this has to await successful phase III stroke trials, which were built on basic research conforming to the criteria as put forward in this article.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disease with neurologic manifestations. In transgenic mouse models of HD, weight loss is recognized as a feature associated with the disease onset. It is unclear whether a similar pattern occurs in humans. METHODS: Data from the Huntington Study Group were used to evaluate whether HD is associated with lower body mass index (BMI) at the earliest stage of the disease. There were 361 case subjects in whom HD had been diagnosed with an independence scale rating of 100 (no special care needed), a total functional capacity score of >or=11, and HD duration of <4 years. For each case subject, five sex- and age-matched control subjects were selected from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study or the Framingham Offspring Study. RESULTS: Among case subjects, neither disease duration, nor dystonia, nor chorea score was significantly associated with BMI. BMI was significantly lower among case than among control subjects. Among men, age-adjusted BMI (+/-SE) was 25.90 +/- 0.34 kg/m(2) for case subjects with HD and 27.68 +/- 0.16 kg/m(2) for control subjects. Among women, corresponding values were 24.34 +/- 0.43 for case subjects with HD and 26.63 +/- 0.21 kg/m(2) for control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: At an early stage of the disease, subjects with Huntington's disease had lower body mass index than matched controls from the general population. The cause of weight loss is unknown but the parallel to observations in Huntington's disease transgenic mice suggests that it is a significant hallmark of Huntington's disease gene expression.},

Isolation stress induced by individually housing each mouse from the time of weaning further decreased hippocampal cell proliferation in Tg2576 mice as well as in non-transgenic littermates at 6 months of age. Decreases in hippocampal cell proliferation in isolated Tg2576 mice were associated with impairments in contextual but not cued memory. Fluoxetine administration increased cell proliferation and improved contextual memory in isolated Tg2576 mice. Further, isolation stress accelerated the age-dependent deposition of beta-amyloid 42 plaques in Tg2576 mice. Numerous beta-amyloid plaques were found in isolated but not non-isolated Tg2576 mice at 6 months of age. These results suggest that Tg2576 mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer disease, have an impaired ability to generate new cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and that the magnitude of this impairment can be modulated by behavioral interventions and drugs known to have effects on hippocampal neurogenesis in normal rodents. Unexpectedly, isolation stress also appeared to accelerate the underlying process of beta-amyloid plaque deposition in Tg2576 mice. These results suggest that stress may have an impact on the underlying disease process associated with Alzheimer's disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Seasonal variations are rarely considered a contributing component to human tissue function or health, although many diseases and physiological process display annual periodicities. Here we find more than 4,000 protein-coding mRNAs in white blood cells and adipose tissue to have seasonal expression profiles, with inverted patterns observed between Europe and Oceania. We also find the cellular composition of blood to vary by season, and these changes, which differ between the United Kingdom and The Gambia, could explain the gene expression periodicity. With regards to tissue function, the immune system has a profound pro-inflammatory transcriptomic profile during European winter, with increased levels of soluble IL-6 receptor and C-reactive protein, risk biomarkers for cardiovascular, psychiatric and autoimmune diseases that have peak incidences in winter. Circannual rhythms thus require further exploration as contributors to various aspects of human physiology and disease.},

  abstract  = {Neurogenesis occurs within the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation and it has been proposed that the newly born neurons, recruited into the preexistent neuronal circuits, might be involved in hippocampal-dependent learning processes. Age-dependent spatial memory impairments have been related to an alteration in hippocampal plasticity. The aim of the current study was to examine whether cognitive functions in aged rats are quantitatively correlated with hippocampal neurogenesis. To this end, we took advantage of the existence of spontaneous individual differences observed in aged subjects in a hippocampal-dependent task, the water maze. We expected that the spatial memory capabilities of aged rats would be related to the levels of hippocampal neurogenesis. Old rats were trained in the water maze, and, 3 weeks after training, rats were injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 50 or 150 mg/kg) to label dividing cells. Cell proliferation was examined one day after the last BrdUrd injection, whereas cell survival and differentiation were determined 3 weeks later. It is shown that a quantitative relationship exists between learning and the number of newly generated neurons. Animals with preserved spatial memory, i.e., the aged-unimpaired rats, exhibited a higher level of cell proliferation and a higher number of new neurons in comparison with rats with spatial memory impairments, i.e., the aged-impaired rats. In conclusion, the extent of memory dysfunction in aged rats is quantitatively related to the hippocampal neurogenesis. These data reinforce the assumption that neurogenesis is involved in memory processes and aged-related cognitive alterations.},

Over the past few years many crucial questions have been answered concerning PSA biosynthesis and function. Among these are the identification and cloning of the key enzymes that are responsible for its synthesis and the fact that expression of PSA is not restricted to developmental stages but maintained in the adult nervous system. In the adult, PSA has been shown to be not only a marker of structural plasticity but seems to be a major player in these processes. Originally suggested to be a purely anti-adhesive factor, modulating cell-cell interactions in general and by this allowing plasticity, there is now increasing evidence that this might not be the whole story. Instead, it appears possible that PSA-NCAM interacts with secreted signaling molecules and by this fulfills a more instructive function in brain plasticity.},

After adjusting for missing studies, we find that the point estimate of the overall effect size is approximately correct and coverage of the effect size confidence intervals is substantially improved, in many cases recovering the nominal confidence levels entirely.

In these experiments, we show that 1) 200 mg/kg is a saturating dose for single injections of BrdU in both control and voluntary exercise animals; 2) there is significantly more cell labeling in animals that exercise when saturating doses of BrdU are employed; 3) high doses of BrdU do not affect the number, appearance, or distribution of labeled cells; 4) voluntary exercise leads to similar increases in the number of cells expressing Ki67, an intrinsic marker of cellular proliferation; 5) both dendritic length and complexity are significantly increased in the DG of animals that exercise; and 6) spine density is significantly greater on dendrites in the DG following voluntary exercise. This study demonstrates that exercise up-regulates neurogenic activity in the DG of adult rats, independently of any putative changes in altered BrdU metabolism, and that it also substantially alters the morphology of dentate granule cell dendrites. The dramatic changes in the cytoarchitecture of the DG induced by voluntary exercise might underlie the enhancement of hippocampal long-term potentiation and hippocampal-dependent memory that our group has previously described. These results suggest that exercise may be an effective component of therapeutic regimes aimed at improving the functioning of individuals with neuropathologies that involve the degradation of cells in the hippocampus.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: A prior national survey documented the high prevalence and costs of alternative medicine use in the United States in 1990. OBJECTIVE: To document trends in alternative medicine use in the United States between 1990 and 1997. DESIGN: Nationally representative random household telephone surveys using comparable key questions were conducted in 1991 and 1997 measuring utilization in 1990 and 1997, respectively. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1539 adults in 1991 and 2055 in 1997. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Prevalence, estimated costs, and disclosure of alternative therapies to physicians. RESULTS: Use of at least 1 of 16 alternative therapies during the previous year increased from 33.8\% in 1990 to 42.1\% in 1997 (P < or = .001). The therapies increasing the most included herbal medicine, massage, megavitamins, self-help groups, folk remedies, energy healing, and homeopathy. The probability of users visiting an alternative medicine practitioner increased from 36.3\% to 46.3\% (P = .002). In both surveys alternative therapies were used most frequently for chronic conditions, including back problems, anxiety, depression, and headaches. There was no significant change in disclosure rates between the 2 survey years; 39.8\% of alternative therapies were disclosed to physicians in 1990 vs 38.5\% in 1997. The percentage of users paying entirely out-of-pocket for services provided by alternative medicine practitioners did not change significantly between 1990 (64.0\%) and 1997 (58.3\%) (P=.36). Extrapolations to the US population suggest a 47.3\% increase in total visits to alternative medicine practitioners, from 427 million in 1990 to 629 million in 1997, thereby exceeding total visits to all US primary care physicians. An estimated 15 million adults in 1997 took prescription medications concurrently with herbal remedies and/or high-dose vitamins (18.4\% of all prescription users). Estimated expenditures for alternative medicine professional services increased 45.2\% between 1990 and 1997 and were conservatively estimated at \$21.2 billion in 1997, with at least \$12.2 billion paid out-of-pocket. This exceeds the 1997 out-of-pocket expenditures for all US hospitalizations. Total 1997 out-of-pocket expenditures relating to alternative therapies were conservatively estimated at \$27.0 billion, which is comparable with the projected 1997 out-of-pocket expenditures for all US physician services. CONCLUSIONS: Alternative medicine use and expenditures increased substantially between 1990 and 1997, attributable primarily to an increase in the proportion of the population seeking alternative therapies, rather than increased visits per patient.},

  abstract  = {Previous studies demonstrating olfactory interneuron involvement in olfactory discrimination and decreased proliferation in the forebrain subventricular zone with age led us to ask whether olfactory neurogenesis and, consequently, olfactory discrimination were impaired in aged mice. Pulse labeling showed that aged mice (24 months of age) had fewer new interneurons in the olfactory bulb than did young adult (2 months of age) mice. However, the aged mice had more olfactory interneurons in total than their younger counterparts. Aged mice exhibited no differences from young adult mice in their ability to discriminate between two discrete odors but were significantly poorer at performing discriminations between similar odors (fine olfactory discrimination). Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor heterozygote mice, which have less neurogenesis and fewer olfactory interneurons than their wild-type counterparts, performed more poorly at fine olfactory discrimination than the wild types, suggesting that olfactory neurogenesis, rather than the total number of interneurons, was responsible for fine olfactory discrimination. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses revealed a selective reduction in expression levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) signaling elements in the aged forebrain subventricular zone. Waved-1 mutant mice, which express reduced quantities of transforming growth factor-alpha, the predominant EGFR ligand in adulthood, phenocopy aged mice in olfactory neurogenesis and performance on fine olfactory discrimination tasks. These results suggest that the impairment in fine olfactory discrimination with age may result from a reduction in EGF-dependent olfactory neurogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {The dogmatic view that new neurons are not produced in the adult mammalian brain has been overturned in light of mounting evidence that neurogenesis continues to occur within two neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone and the hippocampus. In mammals, new neurons are incorporated into the hippocampus throughout life and are influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Most studies use captive-bred animals, and no previous studies have examined neurogenesis in free-living rats despite the common use of laboratory rats. In particular, exercise upregulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus and exercise levels would certainly differ between wild and captive populations. Therefore, it is unclear whether results from captive populations can be generalized to natural populations or reflect variations from an artificial and inappropriate "baseline" level. To address this, we compared levels of cell proliferation and the number of immature neurons (using the endogenous markers Ki67 and doublecortin, respectively) in captured wild juvenile and adult Norway rats to three captive strains (Sprague-Dawley, Long-Evans, and Brown Norway) of the same species. Here, we show that the level of cell proliferation and young immature neuron survival in the dentate gyrus of juvenile wild rats is significantly higher than in Sprague-Dawley rats, but not Long-Evans or Brown Norway rats. However, cell proliferation and the number of immature neurons in the hippocampus of adult wild rats are within the normal range of captive-bred rats at all adult ages examined. This finding is surprising given the dissimilar environments, including stressors and opportunities for exercise, encountered by each population. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract    = {The frequency with which scientists fabricate and falsify data, or commit other forms of scientific misconduct is a matter of controversy. Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, "cooking" of data, etc... Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N = 7, 95\%CI: 0.86-4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once--a serious form of misconduct by any standard--and up to 33.7\% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N = 12, 95\% CI: 9.91-19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words "falsification" or "fabrication", and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

  Abstract                 = {We have previously shown that voluntary exercise produces enhanced neurogenesis and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of mice in vitro. In the present experiments we show that rats given access to a running wheel (Runners) exhibit significantly more short-term potentiation and LTP with theta-patterned conditioning stimulation in vivo than do age-matched litter mates (Controls). This increase in LTP appears to reflect an alteration in the induction threshold for synaptic plasticity that accompanies voluntary exercise. Weak theta-patterned stimulation, which did not produce LTP in control subjects, produced a robust and long-lasting LTP in Runners. LTP induction in both groups was dependent upon the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and could be blocked by the competitive antagonist [+/-]-3-[2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl] propanephosphonic acid. Consistent with these findings, we found that mRNA levels for NR2B subtype of NMDA receptor were increased specifically in the DG of Runners. In addition to changes in NR2B mRNA levels, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glutamate receptor 5 mRNA levels were also significantly elevated in the DG of Runners, but not in other areas of the hippocampus. Thus, alterations in the expression of BDNF, and specific glutamate receptor subtypes, may underlie the ability of exercise to enhance neurogenesis and reduce the threshold for LTP in the DG.},

  abstract    = {Previous microarray studies on breast cancer identified multiple tumour classes, of which the most prominent, named luminal and basal, differ in expression of the oestrogen receptor alpha gene (ER). We report here the identification of a group of breast tumours with increased androgen signalling and a 'molecular apocrine' gene expression profile. Tumour samples from 49 patients with large operable or locally advanced breast cancers were tested on Affymetrix U133A gene expression microarrays. Principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering split the tumours into three groups: basal, luminal and a group we call molecular apocrine. All of the molecular apocrine tumours have strong apocrine features on histological examination (P=0.0002). The molecular apocrine group is androgen receptor (AR) positive and contains all of the ER-negative tumours outside the basal group. Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing indicates that oestrogen signalling is most active in the luminal group, and androgen signalling is most active in the molecular apocrine group. ERBB2 amplification is commoner in the molecular apocrine than the other groups. Genes that best split the three groups were identified by Wilcoxon test. Correlation of the average expression profile of these genes in our data with the expression profile of individual tumours in four published breast cancer studies suggest that molecular apocrine tumours represent 8-14\% of tumours in these studies. Our data show that it is possible with microarray data to divide mammary tumour cells into three groups based on steroid receptor activity: luminal (ER+ AR+), basal (ER- AR-) and molecular apocrine (ER- AR+).},

For normally distributed data, this loss in terms of Fisher's information is at least 1-2/pi (or 36\%). In other words, 100 continuous observations are statistically equivalent to 158 dichotomized observations. The amount of information lost depends greatly on the prior choice of cut points, with the optimal cut point depending upon the unknown parameters. The loss of information leads to loss of power or conversely a sample size increase to maintain power. Only in certain cases, for instance, in estimating a value of the cumulative distribution function and when the assumed model is very different from the true model, can the use of dichotomized outcomes be considered a reasonable approach.},

This question arises because of the increased risk of Type I errors (findings of false "significance") when multiple simultaneous hypotheses are tested at set p-values. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the need to make appropriate p-value adjustments in clinical trials to compensate for a possible increased risk in committing Type I errors when multiple outcome measures are used.The classicists believe that the chance of finding at least one test statistically significant due to chance and incorrectly declaring a difference increases as the number of comparisons increases. The rationalists have the following objections to that theory: 1) P-value adjustments are calculated based on how many tests are to be considered, and that number has been defined arbitrarily and variably; 2) P-value adjustments reduce the chance of making type I errors, but they increase the chance of making type II errors or needing to increase the sample size.Readers should balance a study's statistical significance with the magnitude of effect, the quality of the study and with findings from other studies. Researchers facing multiple outcome measures might want to either select a primary outcome measure or use a global assessment measure, rather than adjusting the p-value.},

This reduction in neurogenesis did not result in appreciable learning deficits, indicating that addition of new neurons is not required for memory formation. However, our postlearning enrichment experiments lead us to postulate that adult dentate neurogenesis may play a role in the periodic clearance of outdated hippocampal memory traces after cortical memory consolidation, thereby ensuring that the hippocampus is continuously available to process new memories. A chronic, abnormal clearance process in the hippocampus may conceivably lead to memory disorders in the mammalian brain.},

Usually they are more powerful, have higher external validity, are less subject to bias, and produce more reproducible results than the completely randomized designs typically used in research involving laboratory animals. Reproducibility can be further increased by using time as a blocking factor. These benefits can be achieved at no extra cost. A small experiment investigating the effect of an antioxidant on the activity of a liver enzyme in four inbred mouse strains, which had two replications (blocks) separated by a period of two months, illustrates this approach. The widespread failure to use these designs more widely in research involving laboratory animals has probably led to a substantial waste of animals, money, and scientific resources and slowed down the development of new treatments for human and animal diseases.},

  abstract  = {Experiments involving neonates should follow the same basic principles as most other experiments. They should be unbiased, be powerful, have a good range of applicability, not be excessively complex, and be statistically analyzable to show the range of uncertainty in the conclusions. However, investigation of growth and development in neonatal multiparous animals poses special problems associated with the choice of "experimental unit" and differences between litters: the "litter effect." Two main types of experiments are described, with recommendations regarding their design and statistical analysis: First, the "between litter design" is used when females or whole litters are assigned to a treatment group. In this case the litter, rather than the individuals within a litter, is the experimental unit and should be the unit for the statistical analysis. Measurements made on individual neonatal animals need to be combined within each litter. Counting each neonate as a separate observation may lead to incorrect conclusions. The number of observations for each outcome ("n") is based on the number of treated females or whole litters. Where litter sizes vary, it may be necessary to use a weighted statistical analysis because means based on more observations are more reliable than those based on a few observations. Second, the more powerful "within-litter design" is used when neonates can be individually assigned to treatment groups so that individuals within a litter can have different treatments. In this case, the individual neonate is the experimental unit, and "n" is based on the number of individual pups, not on the number of whole litters. However, variation in litter size means that it may be difficult to perform balanced experiments with equal numbers of animals in each treatment group within each litter. This increases the complexity of the statistical analysis. A numerical example using a general linear model analysis of variance is provided in the Appendix. The use of isogenic strains should be considered in neonatal research. These strains are like immortal clones of genetically identical individuals (i.e., they are uniform, stable, and repeatable), and their use should result in more powerful experiments. Inbred females mated to males of a different inbred strain will produce F1 hybrid offspring that will be uniform, vigorous, and genetically identical. Different strains may develop at different rates and respond differently to experimental treatments.},

Investigators are urged to consult a statistician at the design stage and are reminded that no experiment should ever be started without a clear idea of how the resulting data are to be analyzed. These guidelines are provided to help biomedical research workers perform their experiments efficiently and analyze their results so that they can extract all useful information from the resulting data. Among the topics discussed are the varying purposes of experiments (e.g., exploratory vs. confirmatory); the experimental unit; the necessity of recording full experimental details (e.g., species, sex, age, microbiological status, strain and source of animals, and husbandry conditions); assigning experimental units to treatments using randomization; other aspects of the experiment (e.g., timing of measurements); using formal experimental designs (e.g., completely randomized and randomized block); estimating the size of the experiment using power and sample size calculations; screening raw data for obvious errors; using the t-test or analysis of variance for parametric analysis; and effective design of graphical data.},

  abstract    = {To investigate how categorizing body mass index (BMI) into weight classes can impact the assessment of the relationship between BMI and in-hospital mortality after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.BMI-mortality (in-hospital) relationship was assessed in 5,762 patients who underwent isolated CABG at Baylor University Medical Center (Dallas, TX) from January 1, 1997 to November 30, 2003. Different ways of modeling BMI were used to investigate this association in a propensity-adjusted model, controlling for risk factors identified by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and other clinical/nonclinical details.A highly significant (P=0.003) association between BMI (modeled with a restricted cubic spline) and mortality was found. Reduced risk of in-hospital mortality was observed for subjects with BMI in the low-30s as compared with patients with BMI in the mid-20s or over 40 kg/m(2). Results were strongly affected by the way BMI was specified in the multivariable model. Only five of the 10 BMI categorizations considered produced significant results, and these results did not fully determine the effect of BMI on mortality.BMI categorization critically impacts study results. Conceivably, findings of other studies investigating BMI and adverse outcomes after CABG may be similarly affected. Investigators should consider smoothing techniques to avoid categorization.},

Pathologically confirmed IPD encompasses a spectrum of microscopic appearances with respect to the extent and distribution of Lewy Body deposition, which may reflect the clinical phenotypes observed during life. In this review, we discuss how IPD is currently defined and the purpose and applications of a classification of the disease. We have also performed a systematic review of the literature to present the quantitative evidence on which potential classifications of the disease might be based. This evidence suggests that sub-groups based on age of onset, motor presentation, or subsequent motor phenotype may have some use in predicting disease progression. However, further clinicopathological studies are required to evaluate pathological heterogeneity within these groups. Clinical sub-groups may be related to a variety of as yet unknown risks, including genetic factors for both the familial and sporadic forms of the disease, and may have far reaching consequences for our understanding of disease pathogenesis and treatment strategies.},

Immunohistochemical studies show its localization in the soma and leading processes of tangentially migrating neurons, and a strong axonal labeling is observed in differentiating neurons. In cultured neurons, Doublecortin expression is highest in the distal parts of developing processes. We demonstrate by sedimentation and microscopy studies that Doublecortin is associated with microtubules (MTs) and postulate that it is a novel MAP. Our data suggest that the cortical dysgeneses associated with the loss of Doublecortin function might result from abnormal cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal cell development.},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE: Since two recent meta-analyses on sleep changes associated with placebo in clinical trials suggested a beneficial effect of placebo treatments, pointing to a dissociation between subjective and objective measures of sleep, the current experiment was directly aimed to assess the effects of an inert compound, administered with the suggestion that it was a hypnotic substance in subjects with mild sleep complaints. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare subjective, behavioral, polysomnographic (PSG), and quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) changes during a night preceded or not by the intake of two 50-mg lactose capsules. METHODS: Ten female students, selected by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, slept for three consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory, with the experimental (EXP) night defined by the administration of two 50-mg lactose pills. Self-ratings of sleep quality and performance were assessed upon morning awakening of baseline (BSL) and EXP nights. RESULTS: The EXP nights were self-rated as more restful and characterized by a decreased number of nocturnal awakenings than the BSL nights. PSG measures showed that wakefulness after sleep onset significantly decreased during the EXP night as compared to the BSL night. The EXP nights also showed an increase of 0.5-4.0 Hz power during nonrapid eye movement sleep and a decrease of EEG activity in the beta frequency range during rapid eye movement sleep only at central brain sites. A specific improvement of behavioral measures was also found upon morning awakening after the EXP night compared to the BSL night. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of an inert pill improves both the subjective and objective quality of sleep. The reduced sleep fragmentation and the effects on some quantitative EEG markers of sleep homeostasis suggest that the experimental manipulation induced coherent changes in the subsequent sleep, resembling an enhancement of sleep pressure. The regional differences of EEG activity suggest the involvement of a specific physiological mechanism distinct from that of effective treatments.},

Yet irreproducibility in basic biologic and preclinical research is pervasive in both academic and commercial settings. Lack of reproducibility has led to invalidated research breakthroughs, retracted articles, and aborted clinical trials. Concerns and requirements for transparent, reproducible, and translatable research are accelerated by the rapid growth of "post-publication peer review," open access publishing, and data sharing that facilitate the identification of irreproducible data/studies; they are magnified by the explosion of high-throughput technologies, genomics, and other data-intensive disciplines. Collectively, these changes and challenges are decreasing the effectiveness of traditional research quality mechanisms and are contributing to unacceptable-and unsustainable-levels of irreproducibility. The global oncology and basic biologic research communities can no longer tolerate or afford widespread irreproducible research. This article discusses (i) how irreproducibility in preclinical research can ultimately be traced to an absence of a unifying life science standards framework, and (ii) makes an urgent case for the expanded development and use of consensus-based standards to both enhance reproducibility and drive innovations in cancer research.

  abstract    = {Null hypotheses are simple, precise, and theoretically important. Conventional statistical analysis cannot support them; Bayesian analysis can. The challenge in a Bayesian analysis is to formulate a suitably vague alternative, because the vaguer the alternative is (the more it spreads out the unit mass of prior probability), the more the null is favored. A general solution is a sensitivity analysis: Compute the odds for or against the null as a function of the limit(s) on the vagueness of the alternative. If the odds on the null approach 1 from above as the hypothesized maximum size of the possible effect approaches 0, then the data favor the null over any vaguer alternative to it. The simple computations and the intuitive graphic representation of the analysis are illustrated by the analysis of diverse examples from the current literature. They pose 3 common experimental questions: (a) Are 2 means the same? (b) Is performance at chance? (c) Are factors additive?},

We also tested whether the frequencies of the last digit of a sample of 610 test statistics deviated from a uniform distribution (i.e., equally probable digits).11.6\% (21 of 181) and 11.1\% (7 of 63) of the statistical results published in Nature and BMJ respectively during 2001 were incongruent, probably mostly due to rounding, transcription, or type-setting errors. At least one such error appeared in 38\% and 25\% of the papers of Nature and BMJ, respectively. In 12\% of the cases, the significance level might change one or more orders of magnitude. The frequencies of the last digit of statistics deviated from the uniform distribution and suggested digit preference in rounding and reporting.This incongruence of test statistics and P values is another example that statistical practice is generally poor, even in the most renowned scientific journals, and that quality of papers should be more controlled and valued.},

  Abstract                 = {The vast majority of drugs entering human trials fail. This problem (called "attrition") is widely recognized as a public health crisis, and has been discussed openly for the last two decades. Multiple recent reviews argue that animals may be just too different physiologically, anatomically, and psychologically from humans to be able to predict human outcomes, essentially questioning the justification of basic biomedical research in animals. This review argues instead that the philosophy and practice of experimental design and analysis is so different in basic animal work and human clinical trials that an animal experiment (as currently conducted) cannot reasonably predict the outcome of a human trial. Thus, attrition does reflect a lack of predictive validity of animal experiments, but it would be a tragic mistake to conclude that animal models cannot show predictive validity. A variety of contributing factors to poor validity are reviewed. The need to adopt methods and models that are highly specific (i.e., which can identify true negative results) in order to complement the current preponderance of highly sensitive methods (which are prone to false positive results) is emphasized. Concepts in biomarker-based medicine are offered as a potential solution, and changes in the use of animal models required to embrace a translational biomarker-based approach are outlined. In essence, this review advocates a fundamental shift, where we treat every aspect of an animal experiment that we can as if it was a clinical trial in a human population. However, it is unrealistic to expect researchers to adopt a new methodology that cannot be empirically justified until a successful human trial. "Validation with known failures" is proposed as a solution. Thus new methods or models can be compared against existing ones using a drug that has translated (a known positive) and one that has failed (a known negative). Current methods should incorrectly identify both as effective, but a more specific method should identify the negative compound correctly. By using a library of known failures we can thereby empirically test the impact of suggested solutions such as enrichment, controlled heterogenization, biomarker-based models, or reverse-translated measures.},

  Abstract                 = {Short oligonucleotide arrays have several probes measuring the expression level of each target transcript. Therefore the selection of probes is a key component for the quality of measurements. However, once probes have been selected and synthesized on an array, it is still possible to re-evaluate the results using an updated mapping of probes to genes, taking into account the latest biological knowledge available.We investigated how probes found on recent commercial microarrays for human genes (Affymetrix HG-U133A) were matching a recent curated collection of human transcripts: the NCBI RefSeq database. We also built mappings and used them in place of the original probe to genes associations provided by the manufacturer of the arrays.In a large number of cases, 36\%, the probes matching a reference sequence were consistent with the grouping of probes by the manufacturer of the chips. For the remaining cases there were discrepancies and we show how that can affect the analysis of data.While the probes on Affymetrix arrays remain the same for several years, the biological knowledge concerning the genomic sequences evolves rapidly. Using up-to-date knowledge can apparently change the outcome of an analysis.},

  abstract    = {Modelling is fundamental to many fields of science and engineering. A model can be thought of as a representation of possible data one could predict from a system. The probabilistic approach to modelling uses probability theory to express all aspects of uncertainty in the model. The probabilistic approach is synonymous with Bayesian modelling, which simply uses the rules of probability theory in order to make predictions, compare alternative models, and learn model parameters and structure from data. This simple and elegant framework is most powerful when coupled with flexible probabilistic models. Flexibility is achieved through the use of Bayesian non-parametrics. This article provides an overview of probabilistic modelling and an accessible survey of some of the main tools in Bayesian non-parametrics. The survey covers the use of Bayesian non-parametrics for modelling unknown functions, density estimation, clustering, time-series modelling, and representing sparsity, hierarchies, and covariance structure. More specifically, it gives brief non-technical overviews of Gaussian processes, Dirichlet processes, infinite hidden Markov models, Indian buffet processes, Kingman's coalescent, Dirichlet diffusion trees and Wishart processes.},

  abstract  = {In adult rodents, neurons are continually generated in the subventricular zone of the forebrain, from where they migrate tangentially toward the olfactory bulb, the only known target for these neuronal precursors. Within the main olfactory bulb, they ascend radially into the granule and periglomerular cell layers, where they differentiate mainly into local interneurons. The functional consequences of this permanent generation and integration of new neurons into existing circuits are unknown. To address this question, we used neural cell adhesion molecule-deficient mice that have documented deficits in the migration of olfactory-bulb neuron precursors, leading to about 40\% size reduction of this structure. Our anatomical study reveals that this reduction is restricted to the granule cell layer, a structure that contains exclusively gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons. Furthermore, mutant mice were subjected to experiments designed to examine the behavioral consequences of such anatomical alteration. We found that the specific reduction in the newly generated interneuron population resulted in an impairment of discrimination between odors.

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene. Both excitotoxicity and oxidative stress have been proposed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of HD. Since no effective treatment is available, this study was designed to explore the therapeutic potential of erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine that has been found to prevent excitotoxicity, and to promote neurogenesis. To avoid the side effects of a raised hematocrit, we used asialoerythropoietin (asialoEPO), a neuroprotective variant of EPO that lacks erythropoietic effects in mice. R6/2 transgenic HD mice were treated with this cytokine from five to twelve weeks of age. RESULTS: We provide new evidence that cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the R6/2 hippocampus is reduced by 50\% compared to wild-type littermate controls. However, we found that the asialoEPO treatment did not affect the progression of motor symptoms, weight loss or the neuropathological changes. Furthermore, cell proliferation was not enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the chosen protocol of asialoEPO treatment is ineffective in the R6/2 model of HD. We suggest that reduced hippocampal cell proliferation may be an important and novel neuropathological feature in R6 HD mice that could be assessed when evaluating potential therapies.},

This reduction was detected in pre-symptomatic mice, and by 11.5 weeks, R6/2 mice had 66\% fewer newly born cells in the hippocampus. The results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the cell cycle markers Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We did not observe changes in cell proliferation in the R6/2 subventricular zone, indicating that the decrease in cell proliferation is specific for the hippocampus. This decrease corresponded to a reduction in actual hippocampal neurogenesis as assessed by double immunostaining for BrdU and the neuronal marker neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and by immunohistochemistry for the neuroblast marker doublecortin.

To date, little is known about the distribution of DCX protein or its function. Here, we demonstrate that DCX is expressed in migrating neurons throughout the central and peripheral nervous system during embryonic and postnatal development. DCX protein localization overlaps with microtubules in cultured primary cortical neurons, and this overlapping expression is disrupted by microtubule depolymerization. DCX coassembles with brain microtubules, and recombinant DCX stimulates the polymerization of purified tubulin. Finally, overexpression of DCX in heterologous cells leads to a dramatic microtubule phenotype that is resistant to depolymerization. Therefore, DCX likely directs neuronal migration by regulating the organization and stability of microtubules.},

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

  abstract    = {An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that typically presents as a movement disorder but is known to be associated with variable degrees of cognitive impairment including dementia. We investigated the genetic basis of susceptibility to and cognitive heterogeneity of this disease. METHODS: In 659 PD patients, 109 of which were followed up for 3.5 years from diagnosis, and 2,176 control subjects, we studied candidate genes involved in protein aggregation and inclusion body formation, the pathological hallmark of parkinsonism: microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3B), and alpha-synuclein (SNCA). RESULTS: We observed that cognitive decline and the development of PD dementia are strongly associated (p = 10(-4)) with the inversion polymorphism containing MAPT. We also found a novel synergistic interaction between the MAPT inversion polymorphism and the single nucleotide polymorphism rs356219 from the 3' region of SNCA. In our data, carrying a risk genotype at either of these loci marginally increases the risk for development of PD, whereas carrying the combination of risk genotypes at both loci approximately doubles the risk for development of the disease (p = 3 x 10(-6)). INTERPRETATION: Our data support the hypothesis that tau and alpha-synuclein are involved in shared or converging pathways in the pathogenesis of PD, and suggest that the tau inversion influences the development of cognitive impairment and dementia in patients with idiopathic PD. These findings have potentially important implications for understanding the interface between tau and alpha-synuclein pathways in neurodegenerative disorders and for unraveling the biological basis for cognitive impairment and dementia in PD.},

Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this network.Citation bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining authority.The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220,553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding.Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug development is not the only industrial-scientific enterprise subject to government regulations. In some fields of ecology and environmental sciences, the application of statistical methods is also regulated by ordinance. Over the past 20years, ecologists and environmental scientists have argued against an unthinking application of null hypothesis significance tests. More recently, Canadian ecologists have suggested a new approach to significance testing, taking account of the costs of both type I and type II errors. In this paper, we investigate the implications of this for testing in drug development and demonstrate that its adoption leads directly to the likelihood principle and Bayesian approaches.},

A likelihood ratio is the percentage of ill people with a given test result divided by the percentage of well individuals with the same result. Ideally, abnormal test results should be much more typical in ill individuals than in those who are well (high likelihood ratio) and normal test results should be most frequent in well people than in sick people (low likelihood ratio). Likelihood ratios near unity have little effect on decision-making; by contrast, high or low ratios can greatly shift the clinician's estimate of the probability of disease. Likelihood ratios can be calculated not only for dichotomous (positive or negative) tests but also for tests with multiple levels of results, such as creatine kinase or ventilation-perfusion scans. When combined with an accurate clinical diagnosis, likelihood ratios from ancillary tests improve diagnostic accuracy in a synergistic manner.},

Affected individuals display progressive motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms (including depression), leading to terminal decline. Given that transgenic HD mice have decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and that a deficit in neurogenesis has been postulated as an underlying cause of depression, we hypothesized that decreased hippocampal neurogenesis contributes to depressive symptoms and cognitive decline in HD. Fluoxetine, a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression, is known to increase neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of wild-type mouse hippocampus. Here we show that hippocampal-dependent cognitive and depressive-like behavioural symptoms occur in HD mice, and that the administration of fluoxetine produces a marked improvement in these deficits. Furthermore, fluoxetine was found to rescue deficits of neurogenesis and volume loss in the dentate gyrus of HD mice.},

CRMP-2 mediates the intracellular response to collapsin 1/semaphorin 3A, a repulsive extracellular guidance cue for axonal outgrowth. The mutation of UNC-33, a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of CRMP-2, results in abnormality of microtubules in neurites, but the mechanism of CRMP-2 action remains to be clarified. Here, we report that overexpression of human CRMP-2 in Neuro2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, results in blebbing of the cytoplasm. Furthermore, some cells exhibited intranuclear inclusions, which were labeled with antibodies to CRMP-2 and tubulin. CRMP-2 was found to be associated with microtubule bundles in the spindles at the metaphase and in the midbodies at the late telophase in mitotic cells. Thus, it is most likely that failure of complete disassembly of the spindle microtubules during mitosis is responsible for the formation of these intranuclear inclusions. We suggest that CRMP-2 functions by regulating the dynamics of microtubules.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: The analysis of repeated-measures data presents challenges to investigators and is a topic for ongoing discussion in the Archives of General Psychiatry. Traditional methods of statistical analysis (end-point analysis and univariate and multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance [rANOVA and rMANOVA, respectively]) have known disadvantages. More sophisticated mixed-effects models provide flexibility, and recently developed software makes them available to researchers. OBJECTIVES: To review methods for repeated-measures analysis and discuss advantages and potential misuses of mixed-effects models. Also, to assess the extent of the shift from traditional to mixed-effects approaches in published reports in the Archives of General Psychiatry. DATA SOURCES: The Archives of General Psychiatry from 1989 through 2001, and the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 425. STUDY SELECTION: Studies with a repeated-measures design, at least 2 groups, and a continuous response variable. DATA EXTRACTION: The first author ranked the studies according to the most advanced statistical method used in the following order: mixed-effects model, rMANOVA, rANOVA, and end-point analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS: The use of mixed-effects models has substantially increased during the last 10 years. In 2001, 30\% of clinical trials reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry used mixed-effects analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated-measures ANOVAs continue to be used widely for the analysis of repeated-measures data, despite risks to interpretation. Mixed-effects models use all available data, can properly account for correlation between repeated measurements on the same subject, have greater flexibility to model time effects, and can handle missing data more appropriately. Their flexibility makes them the preferred choice for the analysis of repeated-measures data.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the large number of hypothesis tests performed during the process of routine analysis of microarray data, a multiple testing adjustment is certainly warranted. However, when the number of tests is very large and the proportion of differentially expressed genes is relatively low, the use of a multiple testing adjustment can result in very low power to detect those genes which are truly differentially expressed. Filtering allows for a reduction in the number of tests and a corresponding increase in power. Common filtering methods include filtering by variance, average signal or MAS detection call (for Affymetrix arrays). We study the effects of filtering in combination with the Benjamini-Hochberg method for false discovery rate control and q-value for false discovery rate estimation.Three case studies are used to compare three different filtering methods in combination with the two false discovery rate methods and three different preprocessing methods. For the case studies considered, filtering by detection call and variance (on the original scale) consistently led to an increase in the number of differentially expressed genes identified. On the other hand, filtering by variance on the log2 scale had a detrimental effect when paired with MAS5 or PLIER preprocessing methods, even when the testing was done on the log2 scale. A simulation study was done to further examine the effect of filtering by variance. We find that filtering by variance leads to higher power, often with a decrease in false discovery rate, when paired with either of the false discovery rate methods considered. This holds regardless of the proportion of genes which are differentially expressed or whether we assume dependence or independence among genes.The case studies show that both detection call and variance filtering are viable methods of filtering which can increase the number of differentially expressed genes identified. The simulation study demonstrates that when paired with a false discovery rate method, filtering by variance can increase power while still controlling the false discovery rate. Filtering out 50\% of probe sets seems reasonable as long as the majority of genes are not expected to be differentially expressed.},

  abstract    = {Beagle dogs are widely used in preclinical pharmacokinetic, safety, and formulation studies. However, little is known about intestinal and hepatic distribution of major enzymes and transporters involved in oral absorption and presystemic drug metabolism. We characterized mRNA levels of CYP3A12, CYP3A26, CYP2D15, UGT1A6, ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCC1 (MRP1), ABCG2 (BCRP), SLC15A1 (PEPT1), and SLC22A1 (OCT1) in dog liver and along the intestine by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Tissue protein levels of CYP2D15, MDR1, and PEPT1 were obtained by Western blot. Gene distribution and expression variability was statistically described by a generalized additive mixed model smoothing function and correspondence analysis. Results were compared with the expression pattern known for the human orthologs. Hepatic mRNA levels for metabolic enzymes were generally higher than those for membrane transporters, whereas in the intestine the opposite was observed. Hepatic mRNA levels followed the order CYP2D15 > UGT1A6 ≈ CYP3A26 > ABCB1 ≈ SLC15A1 ≈ SLC22A1 > ABCG2 > ABCC1 ≈ CYP3A12. Along the gut, the genes were differentially distributed with greatest expression in duodenum/upper jejunum (ABCG2), middle jejunum (ABCB1 and SLC15A1), or in cecum/colon (ABCC1 and CYP2D15). CYP3A12, CYP3A26, SLC22A1, and UGT1A6 had a rather uniform expression. Intestinal mRNA profiles of CYP2D15, ABCB1, and SLC15A1 correlated with the respective protein levels. Canine CYP3A12/26, CYP2D15, and ABCB1 colonic distributions differed from those of human orthologs, whereas UGT1A6, ABCC1, ABCG2, SLC15A1, and SLC22A1 were comparable to those of humans in both small and large intestine.

Doublecortin is found to be expressed at peak levels during early development of the cerebellum and forebrain, and is expressed in other regions including the tectum, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia.

First, DNA taken from individuals exposed to low and high levels of drinking water arsenic were plated twice on Illumina's Infinium 450 K HumanMethylation Array, once in order of exposure and again following randomization. Second, we conducted simulations in which random CpG sites were drawn from the 450 K array and subjected to pathway analysis using Ingenuity's IPA software.The majority of differentially methylated CpG sites identified in Run One were due to batch effects; few sites were also identified in Run Two. In addition, the pathway analysis software reported many significant associations between our data, randomly drawn from the 450 K array, and various diseases and biological functions.These analyses illustrate the pitfalls of not properly controlling for chip-specific batch effects as well as using pathway analysis software created for gene expression arrays to analyze DNA methylation array data.We present evidence that (i) chip-specific effects can simulate plausible differential methylation results and (ii) popular pathway analysis software developed for expression arrays can yield spurious results when used in tandem with methylation microarrays.},

The objectives of this study were to determine whether NPC proliferation, survival and neuronal differentiation are impaired in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to determine the effects of the pathogenic form of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) on the survival and neuronal differentiation of cultured NPC. The proliferation and survival of NPC in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was reduced in mice transgenic for a mutated form of amyloid precursor protein that causes early onset familial AD. Abeta impaired the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of cultured human and rodent NPC, and promoted apoptosis of neuron-restricted NPC by a mechanism involving dysregulation of cellular calcium homeostasis and the activation of calpains and caspases. Adverse effects of Abeta on NPC may contribute to the depletion of neurons and cognitive impairment in AD.},

We explain that anova calculates the sum of squares for each term in the model formula sequentially (type I sums of squares) and show how anova tables of adjusted sums of squares are composite tables assembled from multiple sequential analyses. A different anova is performed for each explanatory variable or interaction so that each term is placed last in the model formula in turn and adjusted for the others. 3. The sum of squares for each term in the analysis can be calculated after adjusting only for the main effects of other explanatory variables (type II sums of squares) or, controversially, for both main effects and interactions (type III sums of squares). 4. We summarize the main recent developments and emphasize the shift away from the search for the 'right'anova table in favour of presenting one or more models that best suit the objectives of the analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The vast majority of medical interventions introduced into clinical development prove unsafe or ineffective. One prominent explanation for the dismal success rate is flawed preclinical research. We conducted a systematic review of preclinical research guidelines and organized recommendations according to the type of validity threat (internal, construct, or external) or programmatic research activity they primarily address.We searched MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, and the EQUATOR Network website for all preclinical guideline documents published up to April 9, 2013 that addressed the design and conduct of in vivo animal experiments aimed at supporting clinical translation. To be eligible, documents had to provide guidance on the design or execution of preclinical animal experiments and represent the aggregated consensus of four or more investigators. Data from included guidelines were independently extracted by two individuals for discrete recommendations on the design and implementation of preclinical efficacy studies. These recommendations were then organized according to the type of validity threat they addressed. A total of 2,029 citations were identified through our search strategy. From these, we identified 26 guidelines that met our eligibility criteria--most of which were directed at neurological or cerebrovascular drug development. Together, these guidelines offered 55 different recommendations. Some of the most common recommendations included performance of a power calculation to determine sample size, randomized treatment allocation, and characterization of disease phenotype in the animal model prior to experimentation.By identifying the most recurrent recommendations among preclinical guidelines, we provide a starting point for developing preclinical guidelines in other disease domains. We also provide a basis for the study and evaluation of preclinical research practice. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.},

Authors from the Collaborative Approach to Meta Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) collaboration recently found that these features protect against bias in animal stroke studies. We extended the scope the work from CAMARADES to include investigations of treatments for any condition.We conducted an overview of systematic reviews. We searched Medline and Embase for systematic reviews of animal studies testing any intervention (against any control) and we included any disease area and outcome. We included reviews comparing randomized versus not randomized (but otherwise controlled), concealed versus unconcealed treatment allocation, or blinded versus unblinded outcome assessment.Thirty-one systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria: 20 investigated treatments for experimental stroke, 4 reviews investigated treatments for spinal cord diseases, while 1 review each investigated treatments for bone cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, glioma, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and treatments used in emergency medicine. In our sample 29\% of studies reported randomization, 15\% of studies reported allocation concealment, and 35\% of studies reported blinded outcome assessment. We pooled the results in a meta-analysis, and in our primary analysis found that failure to randomize significantly increased effect sizes, whereas allocation concealment and blinding did not. In our secondary analyses we found that randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding reduced effect sizes, especially where outcomes were subjective.Our study demonstrates the need for randomization, allocation concealment, and blind outcome assessment in animal research across a wide range of outcomes and disease areas. Since human studies are often justified based on results from animal studies, our results suggest that unduly biased animal studies should not be allowed to constitute part of the rationale for human trials.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. It leads to progressive dementia, psychiatric symptoms and an incapacitating choreiform movement disorder, culminating in premature death. HD is caused by an increased CAG repeat number in a gene coding for a protein with unknown function, called huntingtin. The trinucleotide CAG codes for the amino acid glutamine and the expanded CAG repeats are translated into a series of uninterrupted glutamine residues (a polyglutamine tract). METHODS: This review describes the epidemiology, clinical symptomatology, neuropathological features and genetics of HD. The main aim is to examine important findings from animal and cellular models and evaluate how they have enriched our understanding of the pathogenesis of HD and other diseases caused by expanded polyglutamine tracts. RESULTS: Selective death of striatal and cortical neurons occurs. It is likely that the HD mutation confers a deleterious gain of function on the protein. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions containing huntingtin and ubiquitin develop in patients and transgenic mouse models of HD. Other proposed mechanisms contributing to neuropathology include excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, impaired energy metabolism, abnormal protein interactions and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although many interesting findings have accumulated from studies of HD and other polyglutamine diseases, there remain many unresolved issues pertaining to the exact roles of intranuclear inclusions and protein aggregates, the mechanisms of selective neuronal death and delayed onset of illness. Further knowledge in these areas will inspire the development of novel therapeutic strategies.},

YAC46 and YAC72 mice show early electrophysiological abnormalities, indicating cytoplasmic dysfunction prior to observed nuclear inclusions or neurodegeneration. By 12 months of age, YAC72 mice have a selective degeneration of medium spiny neurons in the lateral striatum associated with the translocation of N-terminal htt fragments to the nucleus. Neurodegeneration can be present in the absence of macro- or microaggregates, clearly showing that aggregates are not essential to initiation of neuronal death. These mice demonstrate that initial neuronal cytoplasmic toxicity is followed by cleavage of htt, nuclear translocation of htt N-terminal fragments, and selective neurodegeneration.},

However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students-all in the field of psychology-were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers' performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

These biases are strongest when researchers expect a particular result, are measuring subjective variables, and have an incentive to produce data that confirm predictions. To minimize bias, it is good practice to work "blind," meaning that experimenters are unaware of the identity or treatment group of their subjects while conducting research. Here, using text mining and a literature review, we find evidence that blind protocols are uncommon in the life sciences and that nonblind studies tend to report higher effect sizes and more significant p-values. We discuss methods to minimize bias and urge researchers, editors, and peer reviewers to keep blind protocols in mind.},

Second, large litter size seldom makes it practical to measure exposure effects in all offspring of an exposed dam. Such studies commonly involve two-stage sampling: Drawing a random sample of dams for treatment, then drawing a second sample of pups per dam for neurobehavioral measurements. In this article, such sampling was modeled by two different simulations. The first, a standard Monte-Carlo approach, sampled from random-normal distributions for litter mean and within-litter variability. The second simulation sampled without replacement from actual data on weight of all pups in a series of 39 nontreated rat litters. These mutually-supportive approaches demonstrate that litter effects, even over as few as three litters, are generally large and statistically meaningful. Consequently, statistical significance tests are sensitive to litter effects. Inflation of sample size by treating as few as 2 pups per litter as independent measurements can almost triple the nominal 0.05 alpha level. Furthermore, two-stage sampling increases the within-treatment error term and correspondingly reduces statistical power relative to one-stage sampling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract    = {Systematic reviews are generally regarded by professionals in the field of evidence-based medicine as the highest level of medical evidence, and they are already standard practice for clinical studies. However, they are not yet widely used nor undertaken in the field of animal experimentation, even though there is a lot to be gained from the process. Therefore, a gold standard publication checklist (GSPC) for animal studies is presented in this paper. The items on the checklist have been selected on the basis of a literature analysis and the resulting scientific evidence that these factors are decisive in determining the outcome of animal studies. In order to make future systematic reviews and meta-analyses of animal studies possible, to allow others to replicate and build on work previously published, diminish the number of animals needed in animal experimentation (reduction), improve animal welfare (refinement) and, above all, improve the quality of scientific papers on animal experimentation, this publication checklist needs to be used and followed. We have discussed and optimised this GSPC through feedback from interviews with experts in the field of animal experimentation. From these interviews, it became clear that scientists will adopt this GSPC when journals demand it. The GSPC was compared with the current instructions for authors from nine different journals, selected on the basis that they featured a high number of publications on animal studies. In general, the journals' demands for the description of the animal studies are so limited that it is not possible to repeat the studies, let alone carry out a systematic review. By using the GSPC for animal studies, the quality of scientific papers will be improved. The use of the GSPC and the concomitant improvement in the quality of scientific papers will also contribute to decreased variation and increased standardisation and, as a consequence, a reduction in the numbers of animals used and a more reliable outcome of animal studies. It is of major importance that journal editors become convinced of and adopt these recommendations, because only then will scientists follow these guidelines to the full extent.},

  abstract    = {Systematic Reviews (SRs) of experimental animal studies are not yet common practice, but awareness of the merits of conducting such SRs is steadily increasing. As animal intervention studies differ from randomized clinical trials (RCT) in many aspects, the methodology for SRs of clinical trials needs to be adapted and optimized for animal intervention studies. The Cochrane Collaboration developed a Risk of Bias (RoB) tool to establish consistency and avoid discrepancies in assessing the methodological quality of RCTs. A similar initiative is warranted in the field of animal experimentation.We provide an RoB tool for animal intervention studies (SYRCLE's RoB tool). This tool is based on the Cochrane RoB tool and has been adjusted for aspects of bias that play a specific role in animal intervention studies. To enhance transparency and applicability, we formulated signalling questions to facilitate judgment.The resulting RoB tool for animal studies contains 10 entries. These entries are related to selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. Half these items are in agreement with the items in the Cochrane RoB tool. Most of the variations between the two tools are due to differences in design between RCTs and animal studies. Shortcomings in, or unfamiliarity with, specific aspects of experimental design of animal studies compared to clinical studies also play a role.SYRCLE's RoB tool is an adapted version of the Cochrane RoB tool. Widespread adoption and implementation of this tool will facilitate and improve critical appraisal of evidence from animal studies. This may subsequently enhance the efficiency of translating animal research into clinical practice and increase awareness of the necessity of improving the methodological quality of animal studies.},

The stroke research community was among the first to recognize that the motivations inherent in our system of research can cause investigators to take shortcuts, and can introduce bias and reduce generalizability, all of which leads ultimately to the recurrent failure of apparently useful drug candidates in clinical trials. Here, we review the evidence for these problems in stroke research, where they have been most studied, and in other translational research domains, which seem to be bedevilled by the same issues. We argue that better scientific training and simple changes to the way that we fund, assess and publish research findings could reduce wasted investment, speed drug development, and create a healthier research environment. For 'phase III' preclinical studies--that is, those studies that build the final justification for conducting a clinical trial--we argue for a need to apply the same attention to detail, experimental rigour and statistical power in our animal experiments as in the clinical trials themselves.},

Using examples from surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) experiments, we describe several experimental design issues that can corrupt a dataset. Fortunately, the problems we identify can be avoided if attention is paid to potential sources of bias before the experiment is run.

Although many aspects of the signal transduction pathways mediate exercise induced improvement in cognition are elucidated, little is known about the molecular events interrelating physiological stress with synaptic proteins, following physical exercise. Small heat shock proteins (sHSP), HSP27 and alpha-B-crystallin are co-localized to synapses and astrocytes, but their role in the brain is not well-understood. We investigated whether their levels in the hippocampus were modulated by exercise, using a well characterized voluntary exercise paradigm. Since sHSP are known to be regulated by many intracellular signaling molecules in other cells types outside the brain, we investigated whether similar regulation may serve a role in the brain by measuring protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), pGSK3 and the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, p38, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and phospho-c-Jun kinase (pJNK). Results demonstrated exercise-dependent increases in HSP27 and alpha-B-crystallin levels. We observed that increases in sHSP coincided with robust elevations in the presynaptic protein, SNAP25 and the post-synaptic proteins NR2b and PSD95. Exercise had a differential impact on kinases, significantly reducing pAkt and pERK, while increasing p38 MAPK. In conclusion, we demonstrate four early novel hippocampal responses to exercise that have not been identified previously: the induction of (1) sHSPs (2) the synaptic proteins SNAP-25, NR2b, and PSD-95, (3) the MAP kinase p38 and (4) the immediate early gene product MKP1. We speculate that sHSP may play a role in synaptic plasticity in response to exercise.},

There are suggestions that this action may underlie the therapeutic effects of such drugs in depression. Glucocorticoids also regulate neurogenesis, and there are multiple interactions between serotonin and corticoids. Diurnal cortisol rhythms are dysregulated in depression. We explored the role of diurnal variations in corticosterone on the ability of fluoxetine to alter neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. METHODS: We manipulated plasma corticosterone by implanting corticosterone pellets or giving daily corticosterone injections to corticosterone-clamped adrenalectomized or intact rats that received fluoxetine or vehicle treatment. Proliferation of progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus was measured using BrdU or Ki-67. RESULTS: Our results strongly suggest that a diurnal rhythm in corticosterone is necessary for fluoxetine to stimulate neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus in the male rat. Preliminary data suggest this may be related to the 5-HT1A receptor. CONCLUSIONS: If altered neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is part of the therapeutic response to antidepressants such as fluoxetine, the results we report suggest that concurrent manipulation of the HPA axis might improve sensitivity to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in some treatment-resistant patients.},

Depleting 5-HT with p-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg/kg initially followed by 100 mg/kg/day) or stimulating 5-HT1A receptors with 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg, s.c. injections twice daily) for 14 days had no effect on cell proliferation as measured by Ki-67 or BrdU (5-bromo-3-deoxyuridine) immunocytochemistry in the dentate gyrus. However, combined treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine followed by 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased cell proliferation compared with p-chlorophenylalanine alone. Micro-injection of the 5-HT neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the fimbria-fornix (3.0 microg/side) and the cingulate bundle (1.8 microg/side) depleted hippocampal 5-HT locally but did not change cell proliferation 3 weeks after the surgery. However, 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg, twice daily) stimulated cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of hippocampal 5-HT-depleted rats compared with controls. These results suggest that 5-HT(1A) modulates cell proliferation in the hippocampus by a direct post-synaptic effect. Previous studies demonstrate that adrenalectomy increases hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor expression and binding, and thus we investigated whether the effect of adrenalectomy on cell proliferation and survival was dependent on the activity of the 5-HT1A receptors. In contrast to the null effect following twice-daily s.c. injection, 8-OH-DPAT (2.0 mg/kg/day) delivered by s.c. osmotic pumps increased proliferation in intact rats. The 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (1.5 mg/kg/day also delivered by osmotic pump) by itself did not alter cell proliferation, confirming that reduced serotonin activity does not change proliferation, but blocked the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. However, WAY-100635 could not block the stimulating action of adrenalectomy cell proliferation. 5-HT1A mRNA expression was not altered in the hippocampus by adrenalectomy. Thus, the effect of adrenalectomy on cell proliferation and survival is not 5-HT1A dependent, despite the interaction between 5-HT1A and corticosterone.},

In addition, injection of corticosterone (10-40 mg/kg/day) for 8 days significantly reduced proliferation in the dentate gyrus, as expected, measured by both BrdU uptake and Ki-67 immunostaining. Adrenalectomized (ADX) rats with a replacement subcutaneous pellet of corticosterone showed reduced proliferation when given additional corticosterone (10 mg/kg/day for 8 days), but this was prevented by 5-HT depletion (i.c.v. 5,7-DHT). Finally, a dose-response study showed that progressive doses of corticosterone (0-40 mg/kg/day) in ADX rats resulted in diminished suppression of proliferation in 5-HT-depleted compared with 5-HT-intact rats. These results strongly suggest that 5-HT regulates the sensitivity of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus to corticosterone.},

  abstract  = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27% of them, or 48% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

Besides same-team replication, replication by other teams may also succumb to inbreeding, if it cannot fiercely maintain its independence. These patterns include obedient replication and obliged replication. I discuss these replication patterns in the context of associations and effects in the psychological sciences, drawing from the criticism of Coyne and de Voogd of the proposed association between type D personality and cardiovascular mortality and other empirical examples.},

  abstract    = {Newly discovered true (non-null) associations often have inflated effects compared with the true effect sizes. I discuss here the main reasons for this inflation. First, theoretical considerations prove that when true discovery is claimed based on crossing a threshold of statistical significance and the discovery study is underpowered, the observed effects are expected to be inflated. This has been demonstrated in various fields ranging from early stopped clinical trials to genome-wide associations. Second, flexible analyses coupled with selective reporting may inflate the published discovered effects. The vibration ratio (the ratio of the largest vs. smallest effect on the same association approached with different analytic choices) can be very large. Third, effects may be inflated at the stage of interpretation due to diverse conflicts of interest. Discovered effects are not always inflated, and under some circumstances may be deflated-for example, in the setting of late discovery of associations in sequentially accumulated overpowered evidence, in some types of misclassification from measurement error, and in conflicts causing reverse biases. Finally, I discuss potential approaches to this problem. These include being cautious about newly discovered effect sizes, considering some rational down-adjustment, using analytical methods that correct for the anticipated inflation, ignoring the magnitude of the effect (if not necessary), conducting large studies in the discovery phase, using strict protocols for analyses, pursuing complete and transparent reporting of all results, placing emphasis on replication, and being fair with interpretation of results.},

  abstract  = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.},

Information obtained might not be useful or important, and statistical precision or power is often too low or used in a misleading way. Insufficient consideration might be given to both previous and continuing studies. Arbitrary choice of analyses and an overemphasis on random extremes might affect the reported findings. Several problems relate to the research workforce, including failure to involve experienced statisticians and methodologists, failure to train clinical researchers and laboratory scientists in research methods and design, and the involvement of stakeholders with conflicts of interest. Inadequate emphasis is placed on recording of research decisions and on reproducibility of research. Finally, reward systems incentivise quantity more than quality, and novelty more than reliability. We propose potential solutions for these problems, including improvements in protocols and documentation, consideration of evidence from studies in progress, standardisation of research efforts, optimisation and training of an experienced and non-conflicted scientific workforce, and reconsideration of scientific reward systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A decrease in orexin-A (OX-A) levels has been reported to be associated with depression. It is also well known that stress and depression can disrupt neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; however, it is unclear how OX-A is involved in depression and/or neurogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of i.c.v. administration of OX-A on the forced swimming test (FST), an accepted behavioral screen of antidepressant-like activity, and on the cell proliferation with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in the dentate gyrus at 4 days after i.c.v. administration of OX-A. OX-A administration (140 pmol/mouse) led to a significant reduction in animal immobility in the FST, without affecting spontaneous locomotor activities or serum corticosterone levels. In addition, the number of BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus was significantly increased in OX-A-treated mice in vivo; however, OX-A did not affect the percentage of doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus. The proliferation of neural progenitor cells derived from rat fetal brain was not affected by OX-A treatment in vitro, and the orexin receptor 1 (OXR1) protein was not expressed in these cells. Treatment with the OXR1 antagonist SB-334867 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked both the OX-A-induced decrease in the immobility of FST and increase in BrdU-positive. Moreover, the OX-A-induced increase in neuropeptide Y (NPY)-positive cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus was blocked by SB-334867. These results suggest that OX-A induces an antidepressive-like effect, at least in part, via the enhancement of cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus. These effects of OX-A also may be partly relevant to the regulation of the NPY system in the hilus of the dentate gyrus.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The dentate gyrus is one of only two regions of the mammalian brain where substantial neurogenesis occurs postnatally. However, detailed quantitative information about the postnatal structural maturation of the primate dentate gyrus is meager. We performed design-based, stereological studies of neuron number and size, and volume of the dentate gyrus layers in rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) of different postnatal ages. We found that about 40\% of the total number of granule cells observed in mature 5-10-year-old macaque monkeys are added to the granule cell layer postnatally; 25\% of these neurons are added within the first three postnatal months. Accordingly, cell proliferation and neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus peak within the first 3 months after birth and remain at an intermediate level between 3 months and at least 1 year of age. Although granule cell bodies undergo their largest increase in size during the first year of life, cell size and the volume of the three layers of the dentate gyrus (i.e. the molecular, granule cell and polymorphic layers) continue to increase beyond 1 year of age. Moreover, the different layers of the dentate gyrus exhibit distinct volumetric changes during postnatal development. Finally, we observe significant levels of cell proliferation, neurogenesis and cell death in the context of an overall stable number of granule cells in mature 5-10-year-old monkeys. These data identify an extended developmental period during which neurogenesis might be modulated to significantly impact the structure and function of the dentate gyrus in adulthood.},

  abstract    = {The role of adult brain neurogenesis (generating new neurons) in learning and memory appears to be quite firmly established in spite of some criticism and lack of understanding of what the new neurons serve the brain for. Also, the few experiments showing that blocking adult neurogenesis causes learning deficits used irradiation and various drugs known for their side effects and the results obtained vary greatly. We used a novel approach, cyclin D2 knockout mice (D2 KO mice), specifically lacking adult brain neurogenesis to verify its importance in learning and memory. D2 KO mice and their wild-type siblings were tested in several behavioral paradigms, including those in which the role of adult neurogenesis has been postulated. D2 KO mice showed no impairment in sensorimotor tests, with only sensory impairment in an olfaction-dependent task. However, D2 KO mice showed proper procedural learning as well as learning in context (including remote memory), cue, and trace fear conditioning, Morris water maze, novel object recognition test, and in a multifunctional behavioral system-IntelliCages. D2 KO mice also demonstrated correct reversal learning. Our results suggest that adult brain neurogenesis is not obligatory in learning, including the kinds of learning where the role of adult neurogenesis has previously been strongly suggested.},

Doublecortin-immunoreactive cells in the rostral subventricular zone, but not the dentate gyrus, migrated into the ischemic penumbra of the adjacent striatum and, via the rostral migratory stream and lateral cortical stream, into the penumbra of ischemic cortex. These results indicate that after cerebral ischemia, new neurons are directed toward sites of brain injury, where they might be in a position to participate in brain repair and functional recovery.},

More than any other cell type in the brain studied so far, dentate granule cells require hormone levels to be within the physiological range. In the absence of corticosteroids, proliferation and apoptotic cell death are dramatically enhanced. Dendritic morphology and synaptic transmission are compromised. Conversely, prolonged exposure of animals to a high level of corticosterone suppresses neurogenesis and presumably makes dentate granule cells more vulnerable to delayed cell death. These corticosteroid effects on dentate cell and network function are translated into behavioral consequences, in health and disease.},

Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

  abstract    = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

  abstract    = {'Will my study answer my research question?' is the most fundamental question a researcher can ask when designing a study, yet when phrased in statistical terms - 'What is the power of my study?' or 'How precise will my parameter estimate be?' - few researchers in ecology and evolution (EE) try to answer it, despite the detrimental consequences of performing under- or over-powered research. We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the 'informativeness' of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions.We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs.Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly.These results illustrate the inadequacy of standard analytical power analysis methods and the flexibility of simulation-based power analysis for GLMMs. The wider use of these methods should contribute to improving the quality of study design in EE.},

A succession of genetic mutations or epigenetic changes can lead to homeostasis in the crypt being overcome, and subsequent unbounded growth. We consider the dynamics of a single colorectal crypt by using a compartmental approach [Tomlinson IPM, Bodmer WF (1995) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92:], which accounts for populations of stem cells, differentiated cells, and transit cells. That original model made the simplifying assumptions that each cell population divides synchronously, but we relax these assumptions by adopting an age-structured approach that models asynchronous cell division, and by using a continuum model. We discuss two mechanisms that could regulate the growth of cell numbers and maintain the equilibrium that is normally observed in the crypt. The first will always maintain an equilibrium for all parameter values, whereas the second can allow unbounded proliferation if the net per capita growth rates are large enough. Results show that an increase in cell renewal, which is equivalent to a failure of programmed cell death or of differentiation, can lead to the growth of cancers. The second model can be used to explain the long lag phases in tumor growth, during which new, higher equilibria are reached, before unlimited growth in cell numbers ensues.},

  abstract    = {In ecology and evolution generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are becoming increasingly used to test for differences in variation by treatment at multiple hierarchical levels. Yet, the specific sampling schemes that optimize the power of an experiment to detect differences in random effects by treatment/group remain unknown. In this paper we develop a blueprint for conducting power analyses for GLMMs focusing on detecting differences in variance by treatment. We present parameterization and power analyses for random-intercepts and random-slopes GLMMs because of their generality as focal parameters for most applications and because of their immediate applicability to emerging questions in the field of behavioral ecology. We focus on the extreme case of hierarchically structured binomial data, though the framework presented here generalizes easily to any error distribution model. First, we determine the optimal ratio of individuals to repeated measures within individuals that maximizes power to detect differences by treatment in among-individual variation in intercept, among-individual variation in slope, and within-individual variation in intercept. Second, we explore how power to detect differences in target variance parameters is affected by total variation. Our results indicate heterogeneity in power across ratios of individuals to repeated measures with an optimal ratio determined by both the target variance parameter and total sample size. Additionally, power to detect each variance parameter was low overall (in most cases >1,000 total observations per treatment needed to achieve 80\% power) and decreased with increasing variance in non-target random effects. With growing interest in variance as the parameter of inquiry, these power analyses provide a crucial component for designing experiments focused on detecting differences in variance. We hope to inspire novel experimental designs in ecology and evolution investigating the causes and implications of individual-level phenotypic variance, such as the adaptive significance of within-individual variation.},

  abstract    = {Adaptive designs allow planned modifications based on data accumulating within a study. The promise of greater flexibility and efficiency stimulates increasing interest in adaptive designs from clinical, academic, and regulatory parties. When adaptive designs are used properly, efficiencies can include a smaller sample size, a more efficient treatment development process, and an increased chance of correctly answering the clinical question of interest. However, improper adaptations can lead to biased studies. A broad definition of adaptive designs allows for countless variations, which creates confusion as to the statistical validity and practical feasibility of many designs. Determining properties of a particular adaptive design requires careful consideration of the scientific context and statistical assumptions. We first review several adaptive designs that garner the most current interest. We focus on the design principles and research issues that lead to particular designs being appealing or unappealing in particular applications. We separately discuss exploratory and confirmatory stage designs in order to account for the differences in regulatory concerns. We include adaptive seamless designs, which combine stages in a unified approach. We also highlight a number of applied areas, such as comparative effectiveness research, that would benefit from the use of adaptive designs. Finally, we describe a number of current barriers and provide initial suggestions for overcoming them in order to promote wider use of appropriate adaptive designs. Given the breadth of the coverage all mathematical and most implementation details are omitted for the sake of brevity. However, the interested reader will find that we provide current references to focused reviews and original theoretical sources which lead to details of the current state of the art in theory and practice.},

Here we analyse barbering behaviour in 129S1, NMRI, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse strains and some of their F1 hybrids. Our study shows that barbering in mice, depending on their genotype, is a complex behaviour with several distinct contexts or domains. We observed social (dominant) barbering in NMRI and C57BL/6 mice, sexual over-grooming in 129S1 and C57BL/6 mice, maternal barbering in lactating 129S1 and C57BL/6 mice, and stress-evoked barbering in F1 (NMRIx129S1) hybrids. In contrast, aggressive BALB/c mice and their F1 progeny do not use barbering in their behaviour. We suggest that barbering may be an important complex multi-domain behaviour sensitive to various manipulations, and represent a useful index in neurobehavioural research.},

Whether these adult-generated granule cells become functionally integrated into memory networks is not known. We used immunohistochemical approaches to visualize the recruitment of new neurons into circuits supporting water maze memory in intact mice. We show that as new granule cells mature, they are increasingly likely to be incorporated into circuits supporting spatial memory. By the time the cells are 4 or more weeks of age, they are more likely than existing granule cells to be recruited into circuits supporting spatial memory. This preferential recruitment supports the idea that new neurons make a unique contribution to memory processing in the dentate gyrus.},

Another approach that is not as well-known is one that emphasizes accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE). From the AIPE perspective, sample size is chosen such that the expected width of a confidence interval will be sufficiently narrow. The rationales of both approaches are delineated and two procedures are given for estimating the sample size from the AIPE perspective for a two-group mean comparison. One method yields the required sample size, such that the expected width of the computed confidence interval will be the value specified. A modification allows for a defined degree of probabilistic assurance that the width of the computed confidence interval will be no larger than specified. The authors emphasize that the correct conceptualization of sample-size planning depends on the research questions and particular goals of the study.},

  abstract  = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is highly variable and heritable among laboratory strains of mice. Adult neurogenesis is also remarkably plastic and can be modulated by environment and activity. Here, we provide a systematic quantitative analysis of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in two large genetic reference panels of recombinant inbred strains (BXD and AXB/BXA, n = 52 strains). We combined data on variation in neurogenesis with a new transcriptome database to extract a set of 190 genes with expression patterns that are also highly variable and that covary with rates of (i) cell proliferation, (ii) cell survival, or the numbers of surviving (iii) new neurons, and (iv) astrocytes. Expression of a subset of these neurogenesis-associated transcripts was controlled in cis across the BXD set. These self-modulating genes are particularly interesting candidates to control neurogenesis. Among these were musashi (Msi1h) and prominin1/CD133 (Prom1), both of which are linked to stem-cell maintenance and division. Twelve neurogenesis-associated transcripts had significant cis-acting quantitative trait loci, and, of these, six had plausible biological association with adult neurogenesis (Prom1, Ssbp2, Kcnq2, Ndufs2, Camk4, and Kcnj9). Only one cis-acting candidate was linked to both neurogenesis and gliogenesis, Rapgef6, a downstream target of ras signaling. The use of genetic reference panels coupled with phenotyping and global transcriptome profiling thus allowed insight into the complexity of the genetic control of adult neurogenesis.},

While increases in adult neurogenesis are paralleled by improvements on learning tasks and learning itself can promote the survival of newly generated neurons in the hippocampus, a causal link between learning processes and adult hippocampal neurogenesis is difficult to prove. Here, we addressed the related question of whether the baseline level of adult neurogenesis is predictive of performance on the water maze task as a test of hippocampal function. We used ten strains of recombinant inbred mice, based on C57BL/6, which are good learners and show high baseline levels of neurogenesis, and DBA/2, which are known to be poor learners and which exhibit low levels of adult neurogenesis. Two of these strains, BXD-2 and BXD-8, showed a 26-fold difference in the number of newly generated neurons per hippocampus. Over all strains, including the parental strains, there was a significant correlation between the number of new neurons generated in the dentate gyrus and parameters describing the acquisition of the water maze task (slope of the learning curves). Similar results were seen when the parental strains were not included in the analysis. There was no correlation between adult hippocampal neurogenesis and probe trial performance, performance on the rotarod, overall locomotor activity, and baseline serum corticosterone levels. This result supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis is involved in specific aspects of hippocampal function, particularly the acquisition of new information.},

Proliferation of was similar in the four strains, with the extremes being A/J, which had about 2100+/-570 (mean+/-S.D.) labeled newborn cells per dentate gyrus (after 6 days of bromodeoxyuridine injections), and DBA/2J, which had approximately 1400+/-260.

Survival in C3H/HeJ was significantly different from DBA/2. Phenotypic analysis revealed that DBA/2J produced significantly fewer new neurons than A/J and C3H/HeJ (47\% vs. 63\% and 67\%) but significantly more new astrocytes than A/J and C3H/HeJ (28\% vs. 9\% and 11\%). In absolute terms there were 370+/-120 new neurons in C3H/HeJ, 250+/-60 in A/J, 130+/-50 in DBA/2J, and 190+/-130 in M. spretus.

Neurogenesis was investigated by confocal microscopy of three-channel immunofluorescent staining for the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and neuronal and glial markers. Quantification was performed with unbiased stereological counting techniques. Neurogenesis decreased with increasing age. Stimulation of adult and aged mice by switching from standard housing to an enriched environment with opportunities for social interaction, exploration, and physical activity for 68 d resulted in an increased survival of labeled cells. Phenotypic analysis revealed that, in enriched living animals, relatively more cells differentiated into neurons, resulting in a threefold net increase of BrdU-labeled neurons in 20-month-old mice (105 vs 32 cells) and a more than twofold increase in 8-month-old mice (684 vs 285 cells) compared with littermates living under standard laboratory conditions. Corresponding absolute numbers of BrdU-positive astrocytes and BrdU-positive cells that did not show colabeling for neuronal or glial markers were not influenced. The effect on the relative distribution of phenotypes can be interpreted as a survival-promoting effect that is selective for neurons. Proliferation of progenitor cells appeared unaffected by environmental stimulation.},

Over 6 days C57BL/6 produced 0.36\% of their total granule cell number of 239,000 as new neurons, BALB/c 0.30\% of 242,000, CD1 (ICR) 0.32\% of 351,000, and 129/SvJ 0.16\% of 280,000. These results show that different aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are differentially influenced by the genetic background.},

  abstract    = {Drug-likeness is a frequently invoked, although not always precisely defined, concept in drug discovery. Opinions on drug-likeness are to a large extent shaped by the relationships that are observed between surrogate measures of drug-likeness (e.g. aqueous solubility; permeability; pharmacological promiscuity) and fundamental physicochemical properties (e.g. lipophilicity; molecular size). This article draws on examples from the literature to highlight approaches to data analysis that exaggerate trends in data and the term correlation inflation is introduced in the context of drug discovery. Averaging groups of data points prior to analysis is a common cause of correlation inflation and results from analysis of binned continuous data should always be treated with caution.},

Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing ' s costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},

This increases the scientific validity of the results, and maximises the knowledge gained from each experiment. A minimum amount of relevant information must be included in scientific publications to ensure that the methods and results of a study can be reviewed, analysed and repeated. Omitting essential information can raise scientific and ethical concerns. We report the findings of a systematic survey of reporting, experimental design and statistical analysis in published biomedical research using laboratory animals. Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting research on live rats, mice and non-human primates carried out in UK and US publicly funded research establishments. Detailed information was collected from 271 publications, about the objective or hypothesis of the study, the number, sex, age and/or weight of animals used, and experimental and statistical methods. Only 59\% of the studies stated the hypothesis or objective of the study and the number and characteristics of the animals used. Appropriate and efficient experimental design is a critical component of high-quality science. Most of the papers surveyed did not use randomisation (87\%) or blinding (86\%), to reduce bias in animal selection and outcome assessment. Only 70\% of the publications that used statistical methods described their methods and presented the results with a measure of error or variability. This survey has identified a number of issues that need to be addressed in order to improve experimental design and reporting in publications describing research using animals. Scientific publication is a powerful and important source of information; the authors of scientific publications therefore have a responsibility to describe their methods and results comprehensively, accurately and transparently, and peer reviewers and journal editors share the responsibility to ensure that published studies fulfil these criteria.},

We suggest that each challenge is best met by two different, complementary modes of investigation. In the first (exploratory investigation), researchers should aim at generating robust pathophysiological theories of disease. In the second (confirmatory investigation), researchers should aim at demonstrating strong and reproducible treatment effects in relevant animal models. Each mode entails different study designs, confronts different validity threats, and supports different kinds of inferences. Research policies should seek to disentangle the two modes and leverage their complementarity. In particular, policies should discourage the common use of exploratory studies to support confirmatory inferences, promote a greater volume of confirmatory investigation, and customize design and reporting guidelines for each mode.},

This transgenic expresses exon 1 of the human HD gene with approximately 150 CAG repeats and displays a progressive behavioral phenotype associated with numerous neuronal alterations. Intracellular recordings were obtained using standard techniques from R6/2 and age-matched WT mice. Few electrophysiological changes occurred in striatal neurons from presymptomatic R6/2 mice. The changes in this age group were increased neuronal input resistance and lower stimulus intensity to evoke action potentials (rheobase). Symptomatic R6/2 mice exhibited numerous electrophysiological alterations, including depolarized resting membrane potentials, increased input resistances, decreased membrane time constants, and alterations in action potentials. Increased stimulus intensities were required to evoke excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in neurons from symptomatic R6/2 transgenics. These EPSPs had slower rise times and did not decay back to baseline by 45 ms, suggesting a more prominent component mediated by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Neurons from both pre- and symptomatic R6/2 mice exhibited reduced paired-pulse facilitation. Data from biocytin-filled or Golgi-impregnated neurons demonstrated decreased dendritic spine densities, smaller diameters of dendritic shafts, and smaller dendritic fields in symptomatic R6/2 mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that passive and active membrane and synaptic properties of medium-sized spiny neurons are altered in the R6/2 transgenic. These physiological and morphological alterations will affect communication in the basal ganglia circuitry. Furthermore, they suggest areas to target for pharmacotherapies to alleviate and reduce the symptoms of HD.},

Here, we adopt methods from clinical research for a late-stage pre-clinical meta-analysis (MA) and randomized confirmatory trial (pRCT) approach. A profound body of literature suggests NOX2 to be a major therapeutic target in stroke. Systematic review and MA of all available NOX2(-/y) studies revealed a positive publication bias and lack of statistical power to detect a relevant reduction in infarct size. A fully powered multi-center pRCT rejects NOX2 as a target to improve neurofunctional outcomes or achieve a translationally relevant infarct size reduction. Thus stringent statistical thresholds, reporting negative data and a MA-pRCT approach can ensure biomedical data validity and overcome risks of bias.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Essentially all knowledge about adult hippocampal neurogenesis in humans still comes from one seminal study by Eriksson et al. in 1998, although several others have provided suggestive findings. But only little information has been available in how far the situation in animal models would reflect the conditions in the adult and aging human brain. We therefore here mapped numerous features associated with adult neurogenesis in rodents in samples from human hippocampus across the entire lifespan. Such data would not offer proof of adult neurogenesis in humans, because it is based on the assumption that humans and rodents share marker expression patterns in adult neurogenesis. Nevertheless, together the data provide valuable information at least about the presence of markers, for which a link to adult neurogenesis might more reasonably be assumed than for others, in the adult human brain and their change with increasing age. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In rodents, doublecortin (DCX) is transiently expressed during adult neurogenesis and within the neurogenic niche of the dentate gyrus can serve as a valuable marker. We validated DCX as marker of granule cell development in fetal human tissue and used DCX expression as seed to examine the dentate gyrus for additional neurogenesis-associated features across the lifespan. We studied 54 individuals and detected DCX expression between birth and 100 years of age. Caveats for post-mortem analyses of human tissues apply but all samples were free of signs of ischemia and activated caspase-3. Fourteen markers related to adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents were assessed in DCX-positive cells. Total numbers of DCX expressing cells declined exponentially with increasing age, and co-expression of DCX with the other markers decreased. This argued against a non-specific re-appearance of immature markers in specimen from old brains. Early postnatally all 14 markers were co-expressed in DCX-positive cells. Until 30 to 40 years of age, for example, an overlap of DCX with Ki67, Mcm2, Sox2, Nestin, Prox1, PSA-NCAM, Calretinin, NeuN, and others was detected, and some key markers (Nestin, Sox2, Prox1) remained co-expressed into oldest age. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in the adult human hippocampus neurogenesis-associated features that have been identified in rodents show patterns, as well as qualitative and quantitative age-related changes, that are similar to the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents. Consequently, although further validation as well as the application of independent methodology (e.g. electron microscopy and cell culture work) is desirable, our data will help to devise the framework for specific research on cellular plasticity in the aging human hippocampus.},

Many of the newborn cells express neuronal markers and show functional phenotypes relevant for energy-balance control, including a capacity for leptin-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Coadministration of the mitotic blocker cytosine-beta-d-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C) eliminates the proliferation of neural cells and abrogates the long-term, but not the short-term, effect of CNTF on body weight. These findings link the sustained effect of CNTF on energy balance to hypothalamic neurogenesis and suggest that regulated hypothalamic neurogenesis in adult mice may play a previously unappreciated role in physiology and disease.},

The host has evolved mechanisms to detect the death of cells and rapidly investigate the nature of their demise. If cell death is a result of natural causes - that is, it is part of normal physiological processes - then there is little threat to the organism. In this situation, little else is done other than to remove the corpse. However, if cells have died as the consequence of some violence or disease, then both defence and repair mechanisms are mobilized in the host. The importance of these processes to host defence and disease pathogenesis has only been appreciated relatively recently. This article reviews our current knowledge of these processes.},

However, the existence of this neurogenic migratory system in other mammals has remained unknown. Here, we report the presence of a homologue of the rodent SZ/RMS in the adult macaque monkey, a nonhuman Old World primate with a relatively smaller OB. Our results-obtained by using combined immunohistochemical detection of a marker for DNA replication (5-bromodeoxyuridine) and several cell type-specific markers-indicate that dividing cells in the adult monkey SZ generate neuroblasts that undergo restricted chain migration over an extended distance of more than 2 cm to the OB and differentiate into granule interneurons. These findings in a nonhuman primate extend and support the use of the SZ/RMS as a model system for studying neural regenerative mechanisms in the human brain.},

  Abstract                 = {Industry-sponsored clinical drug studies are associated with publication of outcomes that favor the sponsor, even when controlling for potential bias in the methods used. However, the influence of sponsorship bias has not been examined in preclinical animal studies. We performed a meta-analysis of preclinical statin studies to determine whether industry sponsorship is associated with either increased effect sizes of efficacy outcomes and/or risks of bias in a cohort of published preclinical statin studies. We searched Medline (January 1966-April 2012) and identified 63 studies evaluating the effects of statins on atherosclerosis outcomes in animals. Two coders independently extracted study design criteria aimed at reducing bias, results for all relevant outcomes, sponsorship source, and investigator financial ties. The I(2) statistic was used to examine heterogeneity. We calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) for each outcome and pooled data across studies to estimate the pooled average SMD using random effects models. In a priori subgroup analyses, we assessed statin efficacy by outcome measured, sponsorship source, presence or absence of financial conflict information, use of an optimal time window for outcome assessment, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization. The effect of statins was significantly larger for studies sponsored by nonindustry sources (-1.99; 95\% CI -2.68, -1.31) versus studies sponsored by industry (-0.73; 95\% CI -1.00, -0.47) (p value<0.001). Statin efficacy did not differ by disclosure of financial conflict information, use of an optimal time window for outcome assessment, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization. Possible reasons for the differences between nonindustry- and industry-sponsored studies, such as selective reporting of outcomes, require further study.},

I use a data set of over 135'000 p values from more than five thousand papers. I inspect (1) the way in which the p values are reported and (2) their distribution. The main findings are following: first, it appears that some authors choose the mode of reporting their results in an arbitrary way. Moreover, they often end up doing it in such a way that makes their findings seem more statistically significant than they really are (which is well known to improve the chances for publication). Specifically, they frequently report p values "just above" significance thresholds directly, whereas other values are reported by means of inequalities (e.g. "p<.1"), they round the p values down more eagerly than up and appear to choose between the significance thresholds and between one- and two-sided tests only after seeing the data. Further, about 9.2\% of reported p values are inconsistent with their underlying statistics (e.g. F or t) and it appears that there are "too many" "just significant" values. One interpretation of this is that researchers tend to choose the model or include/discard observations to bring the p value to the right side of the threshold.},

  abstract  = {Experimental designs involving repeated measurements on experimental units are widely used in physiological research. Often, relatively many consecutive observations on each experimental unit are involved and the data may be quite nonlinear. Yet evidently, one of the most commonly used statistical methods for dealing with such data sets in physiological research is the repeated-measurements ANOVA model. The problem herewith is that it is not well suited for data sets with many consecutive measurements; it does not deal with nonlinear features of the data, and the interpretability of the model may be low. The use of inappropriate statistical models increases the likelihood of drawing wrong conclusions. The aim of this article is to illustrate, for a reasonably typical repeated-measurements data set, how fundamental assumptions of the repeated-measurements ANOVA model are inappropriate and how researchers may benefit from adopting different modeling approaches using a variety of different kinds of models. We emphasize intuitive ideas rather than mathematical rigor. We illustrate how such models represent alternatives that 1) can have much higher interpretability, 2) are more likely to meet underlying assumptions, 3) provide better fitted models, and 4) are readily implemented in widely distributed software products.},

Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, the present study confirms that in the adult rat brain, neuronal progenitor cells divide at the border between the hilus and the granule cell layer (GCL). In adult rats, the progeny of these cells migrate into the GCL and express the neuronal markers NeuN and calbindin-D28k. However, neurogenesis was drastically reduced in aged rats. Six-to 27-month-old Fischer rats were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU to detect newborn cells in vivo and to follow their fate in the dentate gyrus. When killed 4-6 weeks after BrdU labeling, 12- to 27-month-old rats exhibited a significant decline in the density of BrdU-positive cells in the granule cell layer compared with 6-month-old controls. Decreased neurogenesis in aging rats was accompanied by reduced immunoreactivity for poly-sialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, a molecule that is involved in migration and process elongation of developing neurons. When animals were killed immediately (12 hr) after BrdU injection, significantly fewer labeled cells were observed in the GCL and adjacent subgranular zone of aged rats, indicative of a decrease in mitotic activity of neuronal precursor cells. The reduced proliferation was not attributable to a general aged-related metabolic impairment, because the density of BrdU-positive cells was not altered in other brain regions with known mitotic activity (e.g., hilus and lateral ventricle wall). The decline in neurogenesis that occurs throughout the lifespan of an animal can thus be related to a decreasing proliferation of granule cell precursors.},

  Abstract                 = {We aimed to understand the extent of the pursuit for statistically significant results in the prognostic literature of cancer. We evaluated 340 articles included in prognostic marker meta-analyses (Database 1) and 1575 articles on cancer prognostic markers published in 2005 (Database 2). For each article, we examined whether the abstract reported any statistically significant prognostic effect for any marker and any outcome ('positive' articles). 'Negative' articles were further examined for statements made by the investigators to overcome the absence of prognostic statistical significance. We also examined how the articles of Database 1 had presented the relative risks that were included in the respective meta-analyses. 'Positive' prognostic articles comprised 90.6\% and 95.8\% in Databases 1 and 2, respectively. Most of the 'negative' prognostic articles claimed significance for other analyses, expanded on non-significant trends or offered apologies that were occasionally remote from the original study aims. Only five articles in Database 1 (1.5\%) and 21 in Database 2 (1.3\%) were fully 'negative' for all presented results in the abstract and without efforts to expand on non-significant trends or to defend the importance of the marker with other arguments. Of the statistically non-significant relative risks in the meta-analyses, 25\% had been presented as statistically significant in the primary papers using different analyses compared with the respective meta-analysis. We conclude that almost all articles on cancer prognostic marker studies highlight some statistically significant results. Under strong reporting bias, statistical significance loses its discriminating ability for the importance of prognostic markers.},

  Abstract                 = {The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals contains recommended housing densities for rodent species that are commonly used by the scientific community. However, at the time of the Guide's publication, housing density recommendations were based heavily on the professional judgment of qualified scientists. Some scientists therefore question whether rodents can be housed at greater densities, whereas others wonder whether the space currently provided for rodents is sufficient. The present study was designed to determine the effect of housing adult female BALB/c- and C57BL/6-mice in standard 75-in(2) (484-cm(2)) ventilated cages at various housing densities (n = 2, 5, and 10 mice/cage). Measures of weight gain, plasma corticosterone, behavior, and immune parameters were evaluated at 7, 28, and 70 d after housing allocation. Housing BALB/c mice at 10/cage had negative effects on weight gain, corticosterone, behavior, and immune parameters. Housing C57BL/6 mice at 10/cage did not affect immune function or weight gain, although behavior and corticosterone showed statistical trends implying a negative effect Differences associated with housing densities of 2 and 5 mice/cage were less robust for all variables measured. We conclude that housing female BALB/c mice at 10 mice/cage (that is, at twice the Guide-recommended density) affects their physiology. We also conclude that mice vary in their responses in the parameters measured. These observations support the conclusion that it will be extremely challenging to scientifically determine an optimal cage density standard that can be uniformly applied across all mouse strains.},

  abstract    = {Running is a potent stimulator of cell proliferation in the adult dentate gyrus and these newly generated hippocampal neurons seem to be implicated in memory functions. Here we have used a mouse model expressing activated Ras under the direction of the neuronal Synapsin I promoter (named synRas mice). These mice develop down-regulated proliferation of adult hippocampal precursor cells and show decreased short-term recognition memory performances. Voluntary physical activity reversed the genetically blocked generation of hippocampal proliferating cells and enhanced the dendritic arborisation of the resulting doublecortin newly generated neurons. Moreover, running improved novelty recognition in both wild type and synRas littermates, compensating their memory deficits. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed to be a potential mediator of physical exercise acting in the hippocampus on dentate neurons and their precursors. This was confirmed here by the identification of doublecortin-immunoreactive cells expressing tyrosine receptor kinase B BDNF receptor. While no difference in BDNF levels were detected in basal conditions between the synRas mice and their wild type littermates, running was associated with enhanced BDNF expression levels. Thus increased BDNF signalling is a candidate mechanism to explain the observed effects of running. Our studies demonstrate that voluntary physical activity has a robust beneficial effect even in mice with genetically restricted neurogenesis and cognition.},

The effects are constructed in two ways, assuming: 1. contributions to the effects solely in the treatment groups; 2. contrasting contributions in treatment and control groups. The main question is whether the two ANOVA correction methods for imbalance (applying Sums of Squares Type II or III; SS II or SS III) offer satisfactory power in the presence of an interaction. Overall, SS II showed higher power, but results varied strongly. When compared to a balanced dataset, for some unbalanced datasets the rejection rate of H0 of main effects was undesirably higher. SS III showed consistently somewhat lower power. When the effects were constructed with equal contributions from control and treatment groups, the interaction could be re-estimated satisfactorily. When an interaction was present, SS III led consistently to somewhat lower rejection rates of H0 of main effects, compared to the rejection rates found in equivalent balanced datasets, while SS II produced strongly varying results. In data constructed with only effects in the treatment groups and no effects in the control groups, the H0 of moderate and strong interaction effects was often not rejected and SS II seemed applicable. Even then, SS III provided slightly better results when a true interaction was present. ANOVA allowed not always for a satisfactory re-estimation of the unique interaction effect. Yet, SS II worked better only when an interaction effect could be excluded, whereas SS III results were just marginally worse in that case. Overall, SS III provided consistently 1 to 5\% lower rejection rates of H0 in comparison with analyses of balanced datasets, while results of SS II varied too widely for general application.},

We observe technical bias in these datasets and discuss corrective interventions. We then suggest a general procedure to control study design, detect technical bias using linear regression of principal components, correct for batch effects, and re-evaluate principal components. This procedure is implemented in the R package swamp, and as graphical user interface software. In conclusion, high-throughput platforms that generate continuous measurements are sensitive to various forms of technical bias.

The number of marbles that animals bury are count data (non-negative integers), which are bounded below by zero and above by the number of marbles present. Count data are often analysed using normal linear models, which include the t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) as special cases. Linear models assume that the data are unbounded and that the variance is constant across groups. These requirements are rarely met with count data, leading to 95\% confidence intervals that include impossible values (less than zero or greater than the number of marbles present), misleading p-values, and impossible predictions. Transforming the data or using nonparametric methods are common alternatives but transformations do not perform well when many zero values are present and nonparametric methods have several drawbacks.The problems with using normal linear models to analyse marble burying data are demonstrated and generalised linear models (GLMs) are introduced as more appropriate alternatives.GLMs have been specifically developed to deal with count and other types of non-Gaussian data, are straightforward to use and interpret, and will lead to more sensible inferences.},

  abstract    = {In functional genomics experiments, researchers often select genes to follow-up or validate from a long list of differentially expressed genes. Typically, sharp thresholds are used to bin genes into groups such as significant/non-significant or fold change above/below a cut-off value, and ad hoc criteria are also used such as favouring well-known genes. Binning, however, is inefficient and does not take the uncertainty of the measurements into account. Furthermore, p-values, fold-changes, and other outcomes are treated as equally important, and relevant genes may be overlooked with such an approach. Desirability functions are proposed as a way to integrate multiple selection criteria for ranking, selecting, and prioritising genes. These functions map any variable to a continuous 0-1 scale, where one is maximally desirable and zero is unacceptable. Multiple selection criteria are then combined to provide an overall desirability that is used to rank genes. In addition to p-values and fold-changes, further experimental results and information contained in databases can be easily included as criteria. The approach is demonstrated with a breast cancer microarray data set. The functions and an example data set can be found in the desiR package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/desiR/) and the development version is available on GitHub (https://github.com/stanlazic/desiR).},

This is partly due to the difficulty of manipulating levels of neurogenesis without inducing off-target effects, which might also influence behaviour. In addition, the analytical methods typically used do not directly test whether neurogenesis mediates the effect of an intervention on behaviour. Previous studies may have incorrectly attributed changes in behavioural performance to neurogenesis because the role of known (or unknown) neurogenesis-independent mechanisms was not formally taken into consideration during the analysis. Causal models can tease apart complex causal relationships and were used to demonstrate that the effect of exercise on pattern separation is via neurogenesis-independent mechanisms. Many studies in the neurogenesis literature would benefit from the use of statistical methods that can separate neurogenesis-dependent from neurogenesis-independent effects on behaviour.},

This can occur when there are multiple observations on the same subjects, when samples are nested or hierarchically organised, or when measurements are correlated in time or space. Analysis of such data without taking these dependencies into account can lead to meaningless results, and examples can easily be found in the neuroscience literature. RESULTS: A single issue of Nature Neuroscience provided a number of examples and is used as a case study to highlight how pseudoreplication arises in neuroscientific studies, why the analyses in these papers are incorrect, and appropriate analytical methods are provided. 12\% of papers had pseudoreplication and a further 36\% were suspected of having pseudoreplication, but it was not possible to determine for certain because insufficient information was provided. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudoreplication can undermine the conclusions of a statistical analysis, and it would be easier to detect if the sample size, degrees of freedom, the test statistic, and precise p-values are reported. This information should be a requirement for all publications.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: In situ hybridisation (ISH) combined with autoradiography is a standard method of measuring the amount of gene expression in histological sections, but the methods used to quantify gene expression in the resulting digital images vary greatly between studies and can potentially give conflicting results. RESULTS: The present study examines commonly used methods for analysing ISH images and demonstrates that these methods are not optimal. Image segmentation based on thresholding can be subject to floor-effects and lead to biased results. In addition, including the area of the structure or region of interest in the calculation of gene expression can lead to a large loss of precision and can also introduce bias. Finally, converting grey level pixel intensities to optical densities or units of radioactivity is unnecessary for most applications and can lead to data with poor statistical properties. A modification of an existing method for selecting the structure or region of interest is introduced which performs better than alternative methods in terms of bias and precision. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, suggestions are made to reduce bias, increase precision, and ultimately provide more meaningful results of gene expression data.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a common statistical technique in physiological research, and often one or more of the independent/predictor variables such as dose, time, or age, can be treated as a continuous, rather than a categorical variable during analysis - even if subjects were randomly assigned to treatment groups. While this is not common, there are a number of advantages of such an approach, including greater statistical power due to increased precision, a simpler and more informative interpretation of the results, greater parsimony, and transformation of the predictor variable is possible. RESULTS: An example is given from an experiment where rats were randomly assigned to receive either 0, 60, 180, or 240 mg/L of fluoxetine in their drinking water, with performance on the forced swim test as the outcome measure. Dose was treated as either a categorical or continuous variable during analysis, with the latter analysis leading to a more powerful test (p = 0.021 vs. p = 0.159). This will be true in general, and the reasons for this are discussed. CONCLUSION: There are many advantages to treating variables as continuous numeric variables if the data allow this, and this should be employed more often in experimental biology. Failure to use the optimal analysis runs the risk of missing significant effects or relationships.},

  abstract  = {Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease with a lifetime incidence of 2.5\% and a prevalence of at least 2\% in individuals over 70 years old. Patients can be effectively treated with drugs that target the dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway, but over time the efficacy of these medications is limited by the development of profound motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. This has prompted the search for alternative treatments, including the use of cell replacement therapies. Over the last decade, human fetal nigral transplants have demonstrated that dopaminergic neurons can survive and provide clinical benefit for patients with Parkinson's disease. However, there are clearly ethical concerns and a limit to the supply of this tissue as well as more recently anxieties over side effects. As a result, alternative sources of tissue have been investigated, and one such source are stem cells, which provide an attractive renewable tissue supply. In this review, we will discuss the current state-of-the-art and the characteristics of Parkinson's disease that increase its attraction as a target of stem cell therapy against results of current clinical trials using fetal neural grafts. Then we will discuss the various types and sources of stem cells, and some early transplantation results in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Finally we will discuss the prospect of using stem cells to deliver drugs and neurotrophic factors involved in neuroprotective and neuroreparative strategies in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.},

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Animals from the same litter are often more alike compared with animals from differentlitters. This litter-to-litter variation, or "litter effects", can influence the results in addition to the ex-perimental factors of interest. Furthermore, sometimes an experimental treatment can only be appliedto whole litters rather than to individual offspring. An example is the valproic acid (VPA) model ofautism, where VPA is administered to pregnant females thereby inducing the disease phenotype inthe offspring. With this type of experiment the sample size is the number of litters and not the totalnumber of offspring. If such experiments are not appropriately designed and analysed, the results canbe severely biased as well as extremely underpowered. RESULTS: A review of the VPA literature showed that only 9\% (3/34) of studies correctly determinedthat the experimental unit (n) was the litter and therefore made valid statistical inferences. In addition,litter effects accounted for up to 61\% (p <0.001) of the variation in behavioural outcomes, whichwas larger than the treatment effects. In addition, few studies reported using randomisation (12\%)or blinding (18\%), and none indicated that a sample size calculation or power analysis had beenconducted. CONCLUSIONS: Litter effects are common, large, and ignoring them can make replication of findingsdifficult and can contribute to the low rate of translating preclinical in vivo studies into successfultherapies. Only a minority of studies reported using rigorous experimental methods, which is consis-tent with much of the preclinical in vivo literature.},

Results from eleven eligible individual studies were then combined in a meta-analysis to increase precision (representing data from 215 animals) and showed that neurogenesis made a negligible contribution to behaviour (standarised effect  = 0.15; 95\% CI  = -0.04 to 0.34; p = 0.128); other mechanisms accounted for the majority of experimental effects (standardised effect  = 1.06; 95\% CI  = 0.74 to 1.38; p = 1.7×10-11).},

Doublecortin (DCX) and polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) are associated with structural plasticity in the adult mammalian brain, are markers of newly formed neurons in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus, and are highly expressed in primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Animal studies have demonstrated that a reduction in plasticity in the piriform cortex is associated with a selective impairment in odour discrimination. Therefore, the number of DCX and PSA-NCAM immunoreactive cells in the piriform cortex were quantified as measures of plasticity in early stage (fifteen week old) R6/1 transgenic HD mice. The transgenic mice had a large reduction in the number of DCX and PSA-NCAM immunoreactive cells in the piriform cortex, similar to that previously reported in the R6/2 mice. We also tested whether odour discrimination, as well as identification and detection, were impaired in HD patients and found that patients (at a similar disease stage as the mice) had an impairment in odour discrimination and identification, but not odour detection. These results suggest that olfactory impairments observed in HD patients may be the result of reduced plasticity in the primary olfactory cortex.},

This study therefore examined the survival and differentiation of NPCs in presymptomatic and symptomatic R6/1 mice and the effects of environmental enrichment on these variables. Here it is demonstrated that the survival of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU+) NPCs in the dentate gyrus is decreased in the transgenic mice. In addition, the number of doublecortin-positive (DCX+) cells is greatly reduced in these mice, as is the total number of new mature neurons, while the proportion of BrdU+ cells differentiating into mature neurons was not significantly different between genotypes. Furthermore, the DCX+ cells in the R6/1 mice had smaller and irregular-shaped somas, shorter neurites, and migrated a shorter distance into the granular cell layer compared with wild-type mice. Older symptomatic mice housed in an enriched environment had an increased number of BrdU+ and DCX+ cells as well as longer neurites and increased migration of DCX+ cells. There was no significant difference between genotypes or environments in the number of BrdU+ cells in the subventricular zone. These results suggest that decreased neurogenesis might be responsible, in part, for the hippocampal deficits observed in these mice and that environmental enrichment produces morphological changes in newborn granule neurons in both wild-type and R6/1 mice, which could underlie some of the beneficial effects of enrichment.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: It is often desirable to observe how a disease progresses over time in individual patients, rather than graphing group averages; and since multiple outcomes are typically recorded on each patient, it would be advantageous to visualise disease progression on multiple variables simultaneously. METHODS: A variety of vector plots and a path plot have been developed for this purpose, and data from a longitudinal Huntington's disease study are used to illustrate the utility of these graphical methods for exploratory data analysis. RESULTS: Initial and final values for three outcome variables can be easily visualised per patient, along with the change in these variables over time. In addition to the disease trajectory, the path individual patients take from initial to final observation can be traced. Categorical variables can be coded with different types of vectors or paths (e.g. different colours, line types, line thickness) and separate panels can be used to include further categorical or continuous variables, allowing clear visualisation of further information for each individual. In addition, summary statistics such as mean vectors, bivariate interquartile ranges and convex polygons can be included to assist in interpreting trajectories, comparing groups, and detecting multivariate outliers. CONCLUSION: Vector and path plots are useful graphical methods for exploratory data analysis when individual-level information on multiple variables over time is desired, and they have several advantages over plotting each variable separately.},

While many of these studies have found significant results, they suffer from a combination of subjective self-report measures as the primary outcome, a lack of proper controls, often combine music with some type of relaxation therapy, or do not randomise subjects to control and treatment conditions. It is therefore difficult to assess the efficacy of music to induce or improve sleep. The present study therefore examined the effects of music using standard polysomnographic measures and quantitative analysis of the electroencephalogram, along with subjective ratings of sleep quality. In addition, a tones condition was used to compare any effects of music with the effects of general auditory stimulation. Using a counter-balanced within-subjects design, the music was not significantly better than the tones or control conditions in improving sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, wake time after sleep onset, or percent slow wave sleep, as determined by objective physiological criteria.},

Mice were then injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and killed either 1 day or 4 weeks later. Levels of BDNF protein in neurons throughout the hippocampus were decreased in BDNF +/- mice, but were increased by DR in wild-type mice and to a lesser amount in BDNF +/- mice. One day after BrdU injection the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was significantly decreased in BDNF +/- mice maintained on the AL diet, suggesting that BDNF signaling is important for proliferation of neural stem cells. DR had no effect on the proliferation of neural stem cells in wild-type or BDNF +/- mice. Four weeks after BrdU injection, numbers of surviving labeled cells were decreased in BDNF +/- mice maintained on either AL or DR diets. DR significantly improved survival of newly generated cells in wild-type mice, and also improved their survival in BDNF +/- mice, albeit to a lesser extent. The majority of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus exhibited a neuronal phenotype at the 4-week time point. The reduced neurogenesis in BDNF +/- mice was associated with a significant reduction in the volume of the dentate gyrus. These findings suggest that BDNF plays an important role in the regulation of the basal level of neurogenesis in dentate gyrus of adult mice, and that by promoting the survival of newly generated neurons BDNF contributes to the enhancement of neurogenesis induced by DR.},

  abstract  = {The adult brain contains small populations of neural precursor cells (NPC) that can give rise to new neurons and glia, and may play important roles in learning and memory, and recovery from injury. Growth factors can influence the proliferation, differentiation and survival of NPC, and may mediate responses of NPC to injury and environmental stimuli such as enriched environments and physical activity. We now report that neurotrophin expression and neurogenesis can be modified by a change in diet. When adult mice are maintained on a dietary restriction (DR) feeding regimen, numbers of newly generated cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are increased, apparently as the result of increased cell survival. The new cells exhibit phenotypes of neurons and astrocytes. Levels of expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) are increased by DR, while levels of expression of high-affinity receptors for these neurotrophins (trkB and trkC) are unchanged. In addition, DR increases the ratio of full-length trkB to truncated trkB in the hippocampus. The ability of a change in diet to stimulate neurotrophin expression and enhance neurogenesis has important implications for dietary modification of neuroplasticity and responses of the brain to injury and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {High-throughput technologies are widely used, for example to assay genetic variants, gene and protein expression, and epigenetic modifications. One often overlooked complication with such studies is batch effects, which occur because measurements are affected by laboratory conditions, reagent lots and personnel differences. This becomes a major problem when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and lead to incorrect conclusions. Using both published studies and our own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address. We review experimental and computational approaches for doing so.},

Within recent psychological articles, research has found an overrepresentation of p values around this cut-off. The present study examined whether this overrepresentation is a product of recent pressure to publish or whether it has existed throughout psychological research. Articles published in 1965 and 2005 from two prominent psychology journals were examined. Like previous research, the frequency of p values at and just below .05 was greater than expected compared to p frequencies in other ranges. While this overrepresentation was found for values published in both 1965 and 2005, it was much greater in 2005. Additionally, p values close to but over .05 were more likely to be rounded down to, or incorrectly reported as, significant in 2005 than in 1965. Modern statistical software and an increased pressure to publish may explain this pattern. The problem may be alleviated by reduced reliance on p values and increased reporting of confidence intervals and effect sizes.},

Recent data suggest that an important factor in the aetiology of depression may be a deficit in the function and expression of 5-HT(1A) receptors, which has been reported in depressed patients. The present study assessed the possibility that this cortisol abnormality is causal in the 5-HT(1A) receptor deficits. First, a rat model of flattened glucocorticoid rhythm was developed. Controlled release corticosterone pellets implanted for 14 days flattened the corticosterone rhythm and maintained levels constant midway between the nadir and zenith levels observed in sham-operated rats. Secondly, using microdialysis to assess 5-HT release in the hippocampus, the inhibitory response to 8-OHDPAT was measured to determine the sensitivity of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. Corticosterone treatment was found to induce a significant attenuation in the response to 8-OHDPAT, indicating functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. There was no effect of corticosterone treatment on basal extracellular 5-HT levels. The data suggest that the glucocorticoid abnormalities associated with depression may impact on the functioning of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the brain. These findings suggest that resolution of cortisol abnormalities may be a valuable target for pharmacotherapy in the treatment of depression.},

  abstract    = {This paper is intended to assist pharmacologists in making the most of statistical analysis and in avoiding common errors that can lead to false conclusions.A scenario is presented where a pathway inhibitor increased blood pressure responses to an agonist by about one third. The fictional experimenter concludes that the inhibitor enhanced the responses to the agonist, but has not applied any statistical analysis. Questions are asked of the reader, and a discussion of the author's answers is presented.The agonist responses have unequal standard errors, as often seen in data like these concentration-response curves with responses expressed as change from baseline. The uneven variability (heteroscedasticity) violates an assumption of conventional parametric statistical analyses, but can be corrected by data transformation. Expressing the data as absolute blood pressure and then transforming it to log blood pressure eliminated the heteroscedasticity, but made evident an effect of the inhibitor on baseline blood pressure.Statistical analysis is a sensible precaution against mistakes, but cannot protect against all erroneous conclusions. In this scenario, the inhibitor reduced the blood pressure and increased responses to the agonist. However, it is likely that the latter effect was a consequence of the former and thus no conclusion can be safely drawn about any direct interaction between the agonist and the pathway inhibitor from this experiment. Where results are awkward to interpret because of confounding factors such as an altered baseline, statistical analysis may not be very useful in supporting a safe conclusion.},

Analysis of the results, expressed as percentage of control, by a one-way ANOVA yielded P=0.058 and the experimenter concluded that neither drug was effective. The data were expressed as percentage of control because of pairing of the data within each experimental run, a common feature in cell culture experiments. Such data can be analysed with potentially more powerful ANOVA methods equivalent to the paired t-test. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to compare the power of relevant analyses.For data correlated within experimental run (i.e. paired values), transformation to percentage of control improved the power of a one-way ANOVA to detect a real effect, but a randomized block ANOVA (equivalent to a 2-way ANOVA with experiment and treatment as factors) using the raw values was substantially more powerful. The randomized block ANOVA performed well even with uncorrelated data, being only marginally less powerful than the one-way ANOVA.A randomized block ANOVA is far superior to the one-way ANOVA with correlated data, and with uncorrelated data it is only marginally less powerful. Thus where there is, or might reasonably be, such a correlation (e.g. relatedness among the data within a single experimental run, or within a multi-well culture plate, or within an animal, et cetera), use the more powerful randomized block ANOVA rather than one-way ANOVA.},

A scenario, in which an experimenter performed an experiment in two separate stages, combined the control groups for analysis and found some surprising results, is presented. The consequences of combined controls are discussed, appropriate display and analysis of the data are described, and an analysis of the likelihood of erroneous conclusions is made. Comparisons between data from separately conducted experimental series are hazardous when there is any possibility that the properties of the experimental units have changed between the series. Experiments that have been performed independently should be analyzed independently. Unlikely or surprising results should be treated with caution and a high standard of evidence should be required, and verification by repeated experiments should be performed and reported. Box and whisker plots contain more information than plots more commonly used to display for qualitative variables and should be used where the sample size is large enough (say, n > or = 5). In most biomedical experiments the observations are not random samples from large populations as assumed by conventional parametric analyses such as Student's t-test, and so permutation tests, which do not lose their validity when a sampled population is non-normal or when the data are not random samples, should frequently be used instead of Student's t-tests.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the heterogeneity of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) in a data driven manner among a cohort of patients in the early clinical stages of the disease meeting established diagnostic criteria. METHODS: Data on demographic, motor, mood, and cognitive measures were collected from 120 consecutive patients in the early stages of PD (Hoehn and Yahr I-III) attending a specialist PD research clinic. Statistical cluster analysis of the data allowed the existence of the patient subgroups generated to be explored. RESULTS: The analysis revealed four main subgroups: (a) patients with a younger disease onset; (b) a tremor dominant subgroup of patients; (c) a non-tremor dominant subgroup with significant levels of cognitive impairment and mild depression; and (d) a subgroup with rapid disease progression but no cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: This study complements and extends previous research by using a data driven approach to define the clinical heterogeneity of early PD. The approach adopted in this study for the identification of subgroups of patients within Parkinson's disease has important implications for generating testable hypotheses on defining the heterogeneity of this common condition and its aetiopathological basis and thus its treatment.},

We also studied the utility of previously described microplate layout designs in the TGT experiment.Location of the sample on the microplate (location effect) contributes to the variability of TGT measurements. Use of manual pipetting techniques and applications of the TGT to the evaluation of procoagulant enzymatic substances are especially sensitive. The effects were not sensitive to temperature or choice of microplate reader. Smallest location effects were observed with automated dispenser-based calibrated thrombogram instrument. Even for an automated instrument, the use of calibration curve resulted in up to 30\% bias in thrombogenic potency assignment.Use of symmetrical version of the strip-plot layout was demonstrated to help to minimize location artifacts even under the worst-case conditions. Strip-plot layouts are required for quantitative thrombin-generation based bioassays used in the biotechnological field.},

For that reason, procedures to limit bias have been mandated by the FDA when assessing efficacy in clinical trials. The present review shows that the effects of bias in preclinical studies are at least as large as in clinical trials, and since bias is not usually controlled in preclinical proof of concept studies, compounds that actually have little or no therapeutic potential may often be advanced into clinical trials. This possibility is supported by the fact that lack of efficacy is the single biggest reason why compounds fail in the clinic. The shift to target-based discovery during the last 10-15 years may have further increased the effects of bias on preclinical assessments of potential efficacy, and contributed to the continuing decline in clinical success rates. Procedures are available to control for bias during preclinical assessments of potential efficacy, and their use could dramatically increase clinical success rates and substantially reduce the costs of drug discovery and development.},

  Abstract                 = {Although models developed directly to describe marginal distributions have become widespread in the analysis of repeated measurements, some of their disadvantages are not well enough known. These include producing profile curves that correspond to no possible individual, possibly showing that a treatment is superior on average when it is poorer for each individual subject, implicitly generating complex and implausible physiological explanations, including underdispersion in subgroups, and sometimes corresponding to no possible probabilistic data generating mechanism. We conclude that such marginal models may sometimes be appropriate for descriptive observational studies, such as sample surveys in epidemiology, but should only be used with great care in causal experimental settings, such as clinical trials.},

  abstract  = {Cognitive decline is apparent in the early stages of Huntington's disease and progressively worsens throughout the course of the disease. Expression of the human Huntington's disease mutation in mice (R6/2 line) causes a progressive neurological phenotype with motor symptoms resembling those seen in Huntington's disease. Here we describe the cognitive performance of R6/2 mice using four different tests (Morris water maze, visual cliff avoidance, two-choice swim tank, and T-maze). Behavioral testing was performed on R6/2 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates between 3 and 14.5 weeks of age, using separate groups of mice for each test. R6/2 mice did not show an overt motor phenotype until approximately 8 weeks of age. However, between 3.5 and 8 weeks of age, R6/2 mice displayed progressive deterioration in specific aspects of learning in the Morris water maze, visual cliff, two-choice swim tank, and T-maze tasks. The age of onset and progression of the deficits in the individual tasks differed depending on the particular task demands. Thus, as seen in humans with Huntington's disease, R6/2 mice develop progressive learning impairments on cognitive tasks sensitive to frontostriatal and hippocampal function. We suggest that R6/2 mice provide not only a model for studying cognitive and motor changes in trinucleotide repeat disorders, but also a framework within which the functional efficacy of therapeutic strategies aimed at treating such diseases can be tested.},

Under such perspective, physical activity could play an important role in influencing cognitive brain functions including learning and memory. The results of epidemiological studies (cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective) support a positive relationship between cognition and physical activities. Recent meta-analysis confirmed a significant effect of exercise on cognitive functions. However, the biological mechanisms that underlie such beneficial effects are still to be completely elucidated. They include supramolecular mechanisms (e.g. neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and angiogenesis) which, in turn, are controlled by molecular mechanisms, such as BDNF, IGF-1, hormone and second messengers.},

  abstract    = {Understanding the genetic underpinnings of disease is important for screening, treatment, drug development, and basic biological insight. One way of getting at such an understanding is to find out which parts of our DNA, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, affect particular intermediary processes such as gene expression. Naively, such associations can be identified using a simple statistical test on all paired combinations of genetic variants and gene transcripts. However, a wide variety of confounders lie hidden in the data, leading to both spurious associations and missed associations if not properly addressed. We present a statistical model that jointly corrects for two particular kinds of hidden structure--population structure (e.g., race, family-relatedness), and microarray expression artifacts (e.g., batch effects), when these confounders are unknown. Applying our method to both real and synthetic, human and mouse data, we demonstrate the need for such a joint correction of confounders, and also the disadvantages of other possible approaches based on those in the current literature. In particular, we show that our class of models has maximum power to detect eQTL on synthetic data, and has the best performance on a bronze standard applied to real data. Lastly, our software and the associations we found with it are available at http://www.microsoft.com/science.},

  Abstract                 = {Affymetrix microarrays are widely used to measure global expression of mRNA transcripts. That technology is based on the concept of a probe set. Individual probes within a probe set were originally designated by Affymetrix to hybridize with the same unique mRNA transcript. Because of increasing accuracy in knowledge of genomic sequences, however, a substantial number of the manufacturer's original probe groupings and mappings are now known to be inaccurate and must be corrected. Otherwise, analysis and interpretation of an Affymetrix microarray experiment will be in error.AffyProbeMiner is a computationally efficient platform-independent tool that uses all RefSeq mature RNA protein coding transcripts and validated complete coding sequences in GenBank to (1) regroup the individual probes into consistent probe sets and (2) remap the probe sets to the correct sets of mRNA transcripts. The individual probes are grouped into probe sets that are 'transcript-consistent' in that they hybridize to the same mRNA transcript (or transcripts) and, therefore, measure the same entity (or entities). About 65.6\% of the probe sets on the HG-U133A chip were affected by the remapping. Pre-computed regrouped and remapped probe sets for many Affymetrix microarrays are made freely available at the AffyProbeMiner web site. Alternatively, we provide a web service that enables the user to perform the remapping for any type of short-oligo commercial or custom array that has an Affymetrix-format Chip Definition File (CDF). Important features that differentiate AffyProbeMiner from other approaches are flexibility in the handling of splice variants, computational efficiency, extensibility, customizability and user-friendliness of the interface.The web interface and software (GPL open source license), are publicly-accessible at http://discover.nci.nih.gov/affyprobeminer.},

Manual counting is also a laborious task in which consistent objectivity is difficult to achieve. Recently, image analysis has been explored, but the studies reported were limited to histological images acquired at high magnification and containing uniformly stained cells. METHODS: The analyzed material consisted of histological sections from different squamous cell cancers that had stained for proliferation using Ki-67 and cyclin A detection. The first step of the method was based on detecting the overall number of cells irrespective to their stain, using second-order edge detection methodology. Then proliferating cells were located using principal component analysis (PCA) of the color image, combined with histogram thresholding. RESULTS: The algorithms' performances were validated on tissue section images encountered in routine clinical practice by comparison with objective measures of performance and manual cell identification. The algorithms correlated closely with manual counting of all cells (r(2) = 0.96-0.97) and stained cells (4-7\% cell count error). CONCLUSIONS: Cell counting in complex large-scale histological images could be applied in routine practice using edge and color information. The proposed technique provides several benefits, such as speed of analysis, consistency, and automation. Moreover, it is faster than human observation and could replace the laborious task of manual cell counting.},

  abstract    = {Quantitative measurements of environmental factors greatly improve the quality of epidemiologic studies but can pose challenges because of the presence of upper or lower detection limits or interfering compounds, which do not allow for precise measured values. We consider the regression of an environmental measurement (dependent variable) on several covariates (independent variables). Various strategies are commonly employed to impute values for interval-measured data, including assignment of one-half the detection limit to nondetected values or of "fill-in" values randomly selected from an appropriate distribution. On the basis of a limited simulation study, we found that the former approach can be biased unless the percentage of measurements below detection limits is small (5-10\%). The fill-in approach generally produces unbiased parameter estimates but may produce biased variance estimates and thereby distort inference when 30\% or more of the data are below detection limits. Truncated data methods (e.g., Tobit regression) and multiple imputation offer two unbiased approaches for analyzing measurement data with detection limits. If interest resides solely on regression parameters, then Tobit regression can be used. If individualized values for measurements below detection limits are needed for additional analysis, such as relative risk regression or graphical display, then multiple imputation produces unbiased estimates and nominal confidence intervals unless the proportion of missing data is extreme. We illustrate various approaches using measurements of pesticide residues in carpet dust in control subjects from a case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.},

In an effort to minimize these variations, the authors analyzed a number of factors that could contribute to edge effects in cell-based assays. They found that pre-incubation of newly seeded plates in ambient conditions (air at room temperature) resulted in even distribution of the cells in each well. In contrast, when newly seeded plates were placed directly in the CO(2) incubator, an uneven distribution of cells occurred in wells around the plate periphery, resulting in increased edge effect. Here, the authors show that the simple, inexpensive approach of incubating newly seeded plates at room temperature before placing them in a 37 degrees C CO(2) incubator yields a significant reduction in edge effect.},

  abstract  = {Stem cells with the potential to give rise to new neurons reside in different regions of the adult rodents CNS, but in vivo only the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone-olfactory bulb system are neurogenic under physiological condition. Comparative analyses have shown that vast species differences exist in the way the mammalian brain is organized and in its neurogenic capacity. Accordingly, we have demonstrated recently that, in the adult rabbit brain, striking structural plasticity persists in several cortical and subcortical areas. Here, by using markers for immature and mature neuronal and glial cell types, endogenous and exogenously administered cell-proliferation markers, intraventricular cell tracer injections coupled to confocal analysis, three-dimensional reconstructions, and in vitro tissue cultures, we demonstrate the existence of newly formed neurons in the caudate nucleus of normal, untreated, adult rabbit. Our results suggest that neurogenesis in the caudate nucleus is a phenomenon independent from that occurring in the adjacent subventricular zone, mostly attributable to the activity of clusters of proliferating cells located within the parenchyma of this nucleus. These clusters originate chains of neuroblasts that ultimately differentiate into mature neurons, which represent only a small percentage of the total neuronal precursors. These results indicate that striatum of rabbit represents a favorable environment for genesis rather than survival of newly formed neurons.},

By combining immunocytochemistry for polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), neuronal and glial antigens, endogenous and exogenously administered cell-proliferation markers, and light and electron microscopy 3D reconstructions, we show that chains of newly generated neuroblasts exist both inside and outside the subventricular zone of adult rabbits. Two groups of chains were detectable within the mature brain parenchyma: anterior chains, into the anterior forceps of the corpus callosum, and posterior chains, close to the external capsule. Parenchymal chains were not associated with any special glial structures, thus coming widely in contact with the mature nervous tissue, including unmyelinated/myelinated fibers, astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. These chains of cells, unlike those in the subventricular zone, do not display cell proliferation, but they contain BrdUrd administered several weeks before. Telencephalic areas, such as the putamen, amygdala, claustrum, and cortex, adjacent to the chains harbor numerous PSA-NCAM-positive cells. The counting of newly generated cells in these areas shows small differences in comparison with others, and a few cells double-labeled for BrdUrd/PSA-NCAM (after 1-month survival) and for BrdUrd/NeuN (after 2 months) were detectable. These results demonstrate the occurrence of glial-independent chains of migrating neuroblasts, which directly contact the mature brain parenchyma of adult mammals. These chains could provide a possible link between the adult germinative layers and a very low-rate/long-term process of cell addition in the telencephalon.},

But do these biases extend to their sponsorship of non-human animal research? Using systematic review and meta-analysis Bero and colleagues show that, in the case of statins, things are a little more complicated. While the conclusions of industry-sponsored studies were indeed more enthusiastic than warranted by their data, the data themselves painted a picture more conservative than was seen in non-industry-sponsored studies. This behaviour is consistent with maximising the return on investment, seeking robust data before embarking on a clinical trial, and, once that investment has been made, making every effort to "prove" that the drug is safe and effective if this is at all credible. The findings suggest that there is something different about industry-sponsored non-human animal research, perhaps reflecting higher standards than is the case elsewhere. Perhaps the academic community can learn something from our colleagues in the commercial sector.},

Such an assessment might include not only the efficacy of a drug but also the in vivo characteristics and limits--in terms of time window, dose, species, and model of ischemia used--to that efficacy. To our knowledge, such assessments have not been made. Nicotinamide is a candidate neuroprotective drug with efficacy in experimental stroke, but the limits to and characteristics of that efficacy have not been fully described.Systematic review and modified meta-analysis of studies of experimental stroke describing the efficacy of nicotinamide. The search strategy ensured ascertainment of studies published in full and those published in abstract only. DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis was used to account for heterogeneity between studies.Nicotinamide improved outcome by 0.287 (95\% confidence interval 0.227 to 0.347); it was more effective in temporary ischemia models, after intravenous administration, in animals without comorbidities, and in studies published in full rather than in abstract. Studies scoring highly on a quality measure gave more precise estimates of the global effect.Meta-analysis provides an effective technique for the aggregation of data from experimental stroke studies.

Here we show that endogenous neural precursors can be induced in situ to differentiate into mature neurons, in regions of adult mammalian neocortex that do not normally undergo any neurogenesis. This differentiation occurs in a layer- and region-specific manner, and the neurons can re-form appropriate corticothalamic connections. We induced synchronous apoptotic degeneration of corticothalamic neurons in layer VI of anterior cortex of adult mice and examined the fates of dividing cells within cortex, using markers for DNA replication (5-bromodeoxyuridine; BrdU) and progressive neuronal differentiation. Newly made, BrdU-positive cells expressed NeuN, a mature neuronal marker, in regions of cortex undergoing targeted neuronal death and survived for at least 28 weeks. Subsets of BrdU+ precursors expressed Doublecortin, a protein found exclusively in migrating neurons, and Hu, an early neuronal marker. Retrograde labelling from thalamus demonstrated that BrdU+ neurons can form long-distance corticothalamic connections. Our results indicate that neuronal replacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease and CNS injury may be possible through manipulation of endogenous neural precursors in situ.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antidepressants on hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult rat, using the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker for dividing cells. Our studies demonstrate that chronic antidepressant treatment significantly increases the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus and hilus of the hippocampus. Administration of several different classes of antidepressant, but not non-antidepressant, agents was found to increase BrdU-labeled cell number, indicating that this is a common and selective action of antidepressants. In addition, upregulation of the number of BrdU-labeled cells is observed after chronic, but not acute, treatment, consistent with the time course for the therapeutic action of antidepressants. Additional studies demonstrated that antidepressant treatment increases the proliferation of hippocampal cells and that these new cells mature and become neurons, as determined by triple labeling for BrdU and neuronal- or glial-specific markers. These findings raise the possibility that increased cell proliferation and increased neuronal number may be a mechanism by which antidepressant treatment overcomes the stress-induced atrophy and loss of hippocampal neurons and may contribute to the therapeutic actions of antidepressant treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {Because of the known limitations of the Bazett and other heart rate correction formulas, it has been proposed that studies of drug induced QT interval changes should use several different heart rate correction formulas and that the consistency of findings by a majority of such formulas should be considered as valid. The aim of this article was to show that such an approach is inappropriate. Using the database of the EMIAT trial, data of QT and RR intervals were taken from electrocardiograms of the first postrandomization visit of 1,402 patients. Of these, 309 were on amiodarone and beta-blockers, 395 on amiodarone and off beta-blockers, 318 on beta-blockers and off amiodarone, and 380 off amiodarone and off beta-blockers. An investigation of drug induced QT interval changes was modeled by evaluating the corrected QT (QTc) interval differences between patients on and off amiodarone, and on and off beta-blockers. A set of 31 previously published heart rate correction formulas was used. In addition to calculating the QTc difference between on and off drug for each formula, the success of heart rate correction was judged by computing correlation coefficients between QTc and RR intervals (ideally corrected QTc values should be independent of heart rate). The difference between on and off drug QT intervals was also evaluated by logarithmic regression models between uncorrected QT and RR intervals in data taken from patients on and off treatment. The QTc interval prolongation on amiodarone was confirmed by all heart rate correction formulas but the extent of the prolongation differed from formula to formula and ranged from 13.6 to 30.9 ms. Of the 31 formulas, 3 reported QTc interval shortening on beta-blockers (up to -11.8 ms) and 28 reported QTc interval prolongation (up to +16.8 ms). The distribution of the results provided by the different formulas suggested that beta-blocker treatment led to a QTc interval prolongation by approximately 7 ms (e.g., +7.4 ms by the Fridericia formula, P = 0.002). The on treatment QTc changes obtained by different formulas were closely correlated to their correction success. Formulas that provided QTc intervals almost independent of the RR intervals estimated approximately 20 ms QTc prolongation on amiodarone and no QTc change on beta-blockers. QT/RR regression analysis confirmed that while amiodarone led to substantial QT prolongation, there was no change of QT interval on beta-blockers beyond the change in heart rate. The study showed that the concept of "majority voting" by different heart rate correction formulas is inappropriate and may lead to erroneous conclusions.},

  abstract    = {High-throughput screening is an early critical step in drug discovery. Its aim is to screen a large number of diverse chemical compounds to identify candidate 'hits' rapidly and accurately. Few statistical tools are currently available, however, to detect quality hits with a high degree of confidence. We examine statistical aspects of data preprocessing and hit identification for primary screens. We focus on concerns related to positional effects of wells within plates, choice of hit threshold and the importance of minimizing false-positive and false-negative rates. We argue that replicate measurements are needed to verify assumptions of current methods and to suggest data analysis strategies when assumptions are not met. The integration of replicates with robust statistical methods in primary screens will facilitate the discovery of reliable hits, ultimately improving the sensitivity and specificity of the screening process.},

To detect low concentrations of NPCs in vivo, we developed a signal processing method that enabled the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the analysis of the NPC biomarker in both the rodent brain and the hippocampus of live humans. Our findings thus open the possibility of investigating the role of NPCs and neurogenesis in a wide variety of human brain disorders.},

  abstract    = {Hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is modulated by various signals like growth factors, hormones, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters. All of these factors can (but not necessarily do) converge on the activation of the G protein Ras. We used a transgenic mouse model (synRas mice) expressing constitutively activated G12V-Harvey Ras selectively in differentiated neurons to investigate the possible effects onto neurogenesis. H-Ras activation in neurons attenuates hippocampal precursor cell generation at an early stage of the proliferative cascade before neuronal lineage determination occurs. Therefore it is unlikely that the transgenically activated H-Ras in neurons mediates this effect by a direct, intracellular signaling mechanism. Voluntary exercise restores neurogenesis up to wild type level presumably mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Reduced neurogenesis is linked to impairments in spatial short-term memory and object recognition, the latter can be rescued by voluntary exercise, as well. These data support the view that new cells significantly increase complexity that can be processed by the hippocampal network when experience requires high demands to associate stimuli over time and/or space.},

The statistical analysis of such data is often inadequate in two ways: it may fail to settle clinically relevant questions and it may be statistically invalid. A commonly used method which compares groups at a series of time points, possibly with t tests, is flawed on both counts. There may, however, be a remedy, which takes the form of a two stage method that uses summary measures. In the first stage a suitable summary of the response in an individual, such as a rate of change or an area under a curve, is identified and calculated for each subject. In the second stage these summary measures are analysed by simple statistical techniques as though they were raw data. The method is statistically valid and likely to be more relevant to the study questions. If this method is borne in mind when the experiment is being planned it should promote studies with enough subjects and sufficient observations at critical times to enable useful conclusions to be drawn. Use of summary measures to analyse serial measurements, though not new, is potentially a useful and simple tool in medical research.},

The presence of multiple hypothesis tests leads to 3 different conceptualizations of power.

  abstract  = {Examples of the use of relative or ratio data are to be found throughout biomedical sciences and include such variables as stereological component densities per cell volume (morphology), transport rates per tissue volume or membrane surface (physiology), gold labelling frequencies (immunocytochemistry) and amounts of DNA relative to protein (biochemistry). This report emphasizes the potential pifalls associated with drawing biological conclusions and interpretations from relative data when there has been no attempt to monitor the absolute size of the reference space. This is know as the 'reference trap'. The dangers to interpretation inherent in confining results to such data are illustrated using the sorts of data found in current placental studies on fetoplacental angiogenesis and villous trophoblast turnover but are pertinent to many other areas. Where it is possible to do so, these dangers can be avoided by the simple expedient of estimating the size of the pertinent reference space and using this to calculate absolute values. Sometimes (e.g. when relying on biopsy samples), the size of the reference cannot be determined. In such cases, ratio data must be interpreted with due caution.},

  Abstract                 = {The Tox21 Data Challenge has been the largest effort of the scientific community to compare computational methods for toxicity prediction. This challenge comprised 12,000 environmental chemicals and drugs which were measured for 12 different toxic effects by specifically designed assays. We participated in this challenge to assess the performance of Deep Learning in computational toxicity prediction. Deep Learning has already revolutionized image processing, speech recognition, and language understanding but has not yet been applied to computational toxicity. Deep Learning is founded on novel algorithms and architectures for artificial neural networks together with the recent availability of very fast computers and massive datasets. It discovers multiple levels of distributed representations of the input, with higher levels representing more abstract concepts. We hypothesized that the construction of a hierarchy of chemical features gives Deep Learning the edge over other toxicity prediction methods. Furthermore, Deep Learning naturally enables multi-task learning, that is, learning of all toxic effects in one neural network and thereby learning of highly informative chemical features.

In order to utilize Deep Learning for toxicity prediction, we have developed the DeepTox pipeline. First, DeepTox normalizes the chemical representations of the compounds. Then it computes a large number of chemical descriptors that are used as input to machine learning methods. In its next step, DeepTox trains models, evaluates them, and combines the best of them to ensembles. Finally, DeepTox predicts the toxicity of new compounds. In the Tox21 Data Challenge, DeepTox had the highest performance of all computational methods winning the grand challenge, the nuclear receptor panel, the stress response panel, and six single assays (teams ``Bioinf@JKU''). We found that Deep Learning excelled in toxicity prediction and outperformed many other computational approaches like naive Bayes, support vector machines, and random forests.},

The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with onset of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms typically occurring in midlife, followed by unremitting progression and eventual death. We report here that motor presymptomatic R6/1 HD mice show a severe impairment of somatosensory-discrimination learning ability in a behavioral task that depends heavily on the barrel cortex. In parallel, there are deficits in barrel-cortex plasticity after a somatosensory whisker-deprivation paradigm. The present study demonstrates deficits in neocortical plasticity correlated with a specific learning impairment involving the same neocortical area, a finding that provides new insight into the cellular basis of early cognitive deficits in HD.},

  Abstract                 = {Affymetrix GeneChips are widely used for expression profiling of tens of thousands of genes. The large number of comparisons can lead to false positives. Various methods have been used to reduce false positives, but they have rarely been compared or quantitatively evaluated. Here we describe and evaluate a simple method that uses the detection (Present/Absent) call generated by the Affymetrix microarray suite version 5 software (MAS5) to remove data that is not reliably detected before further analysis, and compare this with filtering by expression level. We explore the effects of various thresholds for removing data in experiments of different size (from 3 to 10 arrays per treatment), as well as their relative power to detect significant differences in expression.Our approach sets a threshold for the fraction of arrays called Present in at least one treatment group. This method removes a large percentage of probe sets called Absent before carrying out the comparisons, while retaining most of the probe sets called Present. It preferentially retains the more significant probe sets (p < or = 0.001) and those probe sets that are turned on or off, and improves the false discovery rate. Permutations to estimate false positives indicate that probe sets removed by the filter contribute a disproportionate number of false positives. Filtering by fraction Present is effective when applied to data generated either by the MAS5 algorithm or by other probe-level algorithms, for example RMA (robust multichip average). Experiment size greatly affects the ability to reproducibly detect significant differences, and also impacts the effect of filtering; smaller experiments (3-5 samples per treatment group) benefit from more restrictive filtering (> or =50\% Present).Use of a threshold fraction of Present detection calls (derived by MAS5) provided a simple method that effectively eliminated from analysis probe sets that are unlikely to be reliable while preserving the most significant probe sets and those turned on or off; it thereby increased the ratio of true positives to false positives.},

  abstract    = {Studies of the hippocampus as a target of stress and stress hormones have revealed a considerable degree of structural plasticity in the adult brain. Repeated stress causes shortening and debranching of dendrites in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and suppresses neurogenesis of dentate gyrus granule neurons. Both forms of structural remodeling of the hippocampus appear to be reversible and are mediated by glucocorticoid hormones working in concert with excitatory amino acids (EAA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, along with transmitters such as serotonin and the GABA-benzodiazepine system. Glucocorticoids, EAA, and NMDA receptors are also involved in neuronal damage and death that is caused in pyramidal neurons by seizures and by ischemia. A similar mechanism may be involved in hippocampal damage caused by severe and prolonged psychosocial stress. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging have shown that there is a selective atrophy of the human hippocampus in a number of psychiatric disorders, as well as during aging in some individuals, accompanied by deficits in declarative, spatial, and contextual memory performance. It is therefore important to appreciate how hippocampal dysfunction may play a role in the symptoms of the psychiatric illness and, from a therapeutic standpoint, to distinguish between a permanent loss of cells and a reversible remodeling to develop treatment strategies to prevent or reverse deficits. Remodeling of the hippocampus may be only the tip of the iceberg; other brain regions may also be affected.},

  Abstract                 = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly disabling developmental disorders with a population prevalence of 1-3\%. Despite a strong genetic etiology, there are no current therapeutic options that target the core symptoms of ASD. Emerging evidence suggests that dysfunction of glutamatergic signaling, in particular through metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) receptors, may contribute to phenotypic deficits and may be appropriate targets for pharmacologic intervention. This study assessed the therapeutic potential of 2-methyl-6-phenylethyl-pyrididine (MPEP), an mGluR5-receptor antagonist, on repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors in the valproic acid (VPA) mouse model of autism. Mice were exposed prenatally on day E13 to VPA and assessed for repetitive self-grooming and marble burying behaviors as adults. Anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity were measured in an open-field. VPA-exposed mice displayed increased repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors, consistent with previously published results. Across both marble burying and self-grooming assays, MPEP significantly reduced repetitive behaviors in VPA-treated mice, but had no effect on locomotor activity. These results are consistent with emerging preclinical literature that mGluR5-antagonists may have therapeutic efficacy for core symptoms of autism.},

Recent attention has focused on the possible role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in regulating spatial learning and memory. Therefore, in this study, we have examined levels of hippocampal cell proliferation in relation to water maze performance in aged and young male Fischer 344 rats. Aged rats (24 months old) were divided into aged-unimpaired and aged-impaired groups based on comparison with performance of young animals. Animals received five daily injections of the thymidine-analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and were killed 1 week later. Total numbers of BrdU-labeled cells were quantified in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and hilus and were related to behavioral performance. Whereas aging was associated with a significant reduction in the number of BrdU-labeled cells, behavioral impairment with aging was not associated with a further reduction in BrdU labeling. In the context of aging, these finding do not support a direct relationship of adult hippocampal neurogenesis with learning and memory capability.},

  year      = {2008},
  month = {},
  abstract  = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a severe neurodegenerative condition in which the impairment in voluntary movement is related to functional disability. Clinical assessment of motor deficit currently relies largely on subjective rating scales without objective measurement. We have developed a quick and easy-to-use hand tapping device that enables measurement of (a) the number of taps in 30 seconds, (b) variability in tapping rhythm and (c) fatigue over the testing period. Initial cross-sectional testing of 178 consecutive HD clinic patients using an early model of the device showed that the total number of taps in 30 seconds correlated with the motor UHDRS (Spearmann's rho, r(s) = -0.81, p < 0.0001) and independence scores (r(s) = 0.78, p = 0.01). Longitudinal data from a small cohort followed over 10 years reveals a correlation between total number of taps in 30 seconds and motor UHDRS over time (rs = -0.49, p < 0.001), and suggests the technique may provide an objective measure of disease progression. Further tests on 15 HD patients and 9 controls were repeated three times in a single day using an updated device. The HD group made significantly fewer taps in 30 seconds (median HD = 79, control = 104, p = 0.009) and had greater variability of inter-tap interval (mean interdecile range HD = 148, control = 56, p = 0.016) compared to controls. Both the total number of taps and variability of inter-tap interval correlated with motor UHDRS. Of vital importance for any potential marker of disease progression is that these tapping parameters were reproducible with repeated measurement. Given that hand tapping parameters differ between HD and control populations, they correlate with motor UHDRS over time and are reproducible, we propose that assessment of hand tapping represents a useful objective adjunct to the clinical assessment of HD patients.},

Recent findings highlight the importance of accurate genotype calling algorithms to reduce the inflation in Type I and Type II error rates. Differential results due to genotype calling errors can introduce severe bias in case-control association study results. Using data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 1991 individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 1500 controls from the UK Blood Services (NBS) were genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K array. Different batch sizes and compositions were used in the Bayesian Robust Linear Model with Mahalanobis distance classifier (BRLMM) genotype calling algorithm to assess the batch effect on downstream association analysis. Results show that composition (cases and controls genotyped simultaneously or separate) and size (number of individuals processed by BRLMM at a time) can create 2-3\% discordance in the results for quality control and statistical analysis and may contribute to the lack of reproducibility between GWASs. The changes in batch size are largely responsible for differential single-nucleotide polymorphism results, yet we observe evidence of an interactive effect of batch size and composition that contributes to discordant results in the list of significantly associated loci.},

  Abstract                 = {Most--if not all--potential diagnostic applications in breath research involve different marker concentrations rather than unique breath markers which only occur in the diseased state. Hence, data interpretation is a crucial step in breath analysis. To avoid artificial significance in breath testing every effort should be made to implement method validation, data cross-testing and statistical validation along this process. The most common data analysis related problems can be classified into three groups: confounding variables (CVs), which have a real correlation with both the diseased state and a breath marker but lead to the erroneous conclusion that disease and breath are in a causal relationship; voodoo correlations (VCs), which can be understood as statistically true correlations that arise coincidentally in the vast number of measured variables; and statistical misconceptions in the study design (SMSD). CV: Typical confounding variables are environmental and medical history, host factors such as gender, age, weight, etc and parameters that could affect the quality of breath data such as subject breathing mode, effects of breath sampling and effects of the analytical technique itself. VC: The number of measured variables quickly overwhelms the number of samples that can feasibly be taken. As a consequence, the chances of finding coincidental 'voodoo' correlations grow proportionally. VCs can typically be expected in the following scenarios: insufficient number of patients, (too) many measurement variables, the use of advanced statistical data mining methods, and non-independent data for validation. SMSD: Non-prospective, non-blinded and non-randomized trials, a priori biased study populations or group selection with unrealistically high disease prevalence typically represent misconception of study design. In this paper important data interpretation issues are discussed, common pitfalls are addressed and directions for sound data processing and interpretation are proposed.},

  abstract  = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor, psychiatric and cognitive decline. Marked neuronal loss occurs in the cortex and striatum. HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion (CAG) in the gene encoding the protein huntingtin. Predictive genetic testing has revealed early cognitive deficits in asymptomatic gene carriers at a time when there is little evidence for cell death, suggesting that impaired cognition results from a cellular or synaptic deficit, such as aberrant synaptic plasticity. Altered hippocampal long-term potentiation has been reported in mouse models of HD; however, the relationship between synaptic dysfunction and phenotype progression has not previously been characterized. We examined the age-dependency of aberrant hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the R6/1 mouse model of HD. Long-term depression (LTD) is a developmentally regulated form of plasticity, which normally declines by early adulthood. Young R6/1 mice follow the same pattern of LTD expression as controls, in that they express LTD in the first weeks of life, and then lose the ability with age. Unlike controls, R6/1 synapses later regain the ability to support LTD. This is associated with nuclear localization of mutant huntingtin, but occurs months prior to the formation of nuclear aggregates. We present the first detailed description of a progressive derailment of a functional neural correlate of cognitive processing in HD.},

This validity, represented by the reproducibility of published findings, has come into question recently as investigators from companies have raised the issue of poor reproducibility of published results from academic laboratories. Furthermore, retraction rates in high impact journals are climbing.To examine a microcosm of the academic experience with data reproducibility, we surveyed the faculty and trainees at MD Anderson Cancer Center using an anonymous computerized questionnaire; we sought to ascertain the frequency and potential causes of non-reproducible data. We found that ∼50\% of respondents had experienced at least one episode of the inability to reproduce published data; many who pursued this issue with the original authors were never able to identify the reason for the lack of reproducibility; some were even met with a less than "collegial" interaction.These results suggest that the problem of data reproducibility is real. Biomedical science needs to establish processes to decrease the problem and adjudicate discrepancies in findings when they are discovered.},

We collected detailed information about the characteristics of studies, animals and experimental methods.We retrieved 161 studies.

All studies reported details on the experimental procedure, although many omitted information about animal gender, age or weight. Four percent did not report the number of animals used. None reported the sample size. Fixed- and random-effects models gave different results (ratio of effect size increased by five folds). Heterogeneity was consistently substantial within animal models, for which accounting for covariates had minimal impact. Publication bias is highly suspected across studies.Although statins showed efficacy in animal models, preclinical studies highlighted fundamental problems in the way in which such research is conducted and reported. Results were often difficult to interpret and reproduce. Different meta-analytic approaches were highly inconsistent: a reliable approach to estimate the true parameter was imperceptible. Policies that address these issues are required from investigators, editors and institutions that care about the quality standards and ethics of animal research.},

RNAs from rodents exposed to a running wheel for 3, 7 and 28 days were examined using a microarray with 1176 cDNAs expressed primarily in the brain. The expression of selected genes was quantified by Taqman RT-PCR or RNase protection assay. The largest up-regulation was observed in genes involved with synaptic trafficking (synapsin I, synaptotagmin and syntaxin); signal transduction pathways (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, CaM-KII; mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, MAP-K/ERK I and II; protein kinase C, PKC-delta) or transcription regulators (cyclic AMP response element binding protein, CREB). Genes associated with the glutamatergic system were up-regulated (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, NMDAR-2A and NMDAR-2B and excitatory amino acid carrier 1, EAAC1), while genes related to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system were down-regulated (GABAA receptor, glutamate decarboxylase GAD65). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was the only trophic factor whose gene was consistently up-regulated at all timepoints. These results, together with the fact that most of the genes up-regulated have a recognized interaction with BDNF, suggest a central role for BDNF on the effects of exercise on brain plasticity. The temporal profile of gene expression seems to delineate a mechanism by which specific molecular pathways are activated after exercise performance. For example, the CaM-K signal system seems to be active during acute and chronic periods of exercise, while the MAP-K/ERK system seems more important during long-term exercise.},

  abstract    = {Interval estimates - estimates of parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty - have long been touted as a key component of statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

  abstract  = {This review focuses on the remodeling of brain circuitry associated with epilepsy, particularly in excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA systems, including alterations in synaptic efficacy, growth of new connections, and loss of existing connections. From recent studies on the kindling and status epilepticus models, which have been used most extensively to investigate temporal lobe epilepsy, it is now clear that the brain reorganizes itself in response to excess neural activation, such as seizure activity. The contributing factors to this reorganization include activation of glutamate receptors, second messengers, immediate early genes, transcription factors, neurotrophic factors, axon guidance molecules, protein synthesis, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis. Some of the resulting changes may, in turn, contribute to the permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility. There is increasing evidence that neurogenesis and synaptogenesis can appear not only in the mossy fiber pathway in the hippocampus but also in other limbic structures. Neuronal loss, induced by prolonged seizure activity, may also contribute to circuit restructuring, particularly in the status epilepticus model. However, it is unlikely that any one structure, plastic system, neurotrophin, or downstream effector pathway is uniquely critical for epileptogenesis. The sensitivity of neural systems to the modulation of inhibition makes a disinhibition hypothesis compelling for both the triggering stage of the epileptic response and the long-term changes that promote the epileptic state. Loss of selective types of interneurons, alteration of GABA receptor configuration, and/or decrease in dendritic inhibition could contribute to the development of spontaneous seizures.},

In fact, however, the reproducibility of a large percentage of published findings has been questioned. Undoubtedly, there are many reasons for this, but one reason may be that investigators fool themselves due to a poor understanding of statistical concepts. In particular, investigators often make these mistakes: 1) P-hacking, which is when you reanalyze a data set in many different ways, or perhaps reanalyze with additional replicates, until you get the result you want; 2) overemphasis on P values rather than on the actual size of the observed effect; 3) overuse of statistical hypothesis testing, and being seduced by the word "significant"; and 4) over-reliance on standard errors, which are often misunderstood.},

  Abstract                 = {Null hypothesis significance testing has been under attack in recent years, partly owing to the arbitrary nature of setting α (the decision-making threshold and probability of Type I error) at a constant value, usually 0.05. If the goal of null hypothesis testing is to present conclusions in which we have the highest possible confidence, then the only logical decision-making threshold is the value that minimizes the probability (or occasionally, cost) of making errors. Setting α to minimize the combination of Type I and Type II error at a critical effect size can easily be accomplished for traditional statistical tests by calculating the α associated with the minimum average of α and β at the critical effect size. This technique also has the flexibility to incorporate prior probabilities of null and alternate hypotheses and/or relative costs of Type I and Type II errors, if known. Using an optimal α results in stronger scientific inferences because it estimates and minimizes both Type I errors and relevant Type II errors for a test. It also results in greater transparency concerning assumptions about relevant effect size(s) and the relative costs of Type I and II errors. By contrast, the use of α = 0.05 results in arbitrary decisions about what effect sizes will likely be considered significant, if real, and results in arbitrary amounts of Type II error for meaningful potential effect sizes. We cannot identify a rationale for continuing to arbitrarily use α = 0.05 for null hypothesis significance tests in any field, when it is possible to determine an optimal α.},

  abstract  = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive and fatal neurodegenerative brain disorder caused by an expanded CAG/polyglutamine repeat in the coding region of the gene. Presymptomatic Huntington's disease patients often exhibit cognitive deficits before the onset of classical symptoms. To investigate the possibility that changes in synaptic plasticity might underlie cognitive impairment in HD, we examined hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial cognition in a transgenic mouse (R6/2 line) expressing exon 1 of the human Huntington's disease gene containing an expanded CAG repeat. This mouse exhibits a progressive and fatal neurological phenotype that resembles Huntington's disease. We report that R6/2 mice show marked alterations in synaptic plasticity at both CA1 and dentate granule cell synapses, and impaired spatial cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. The changes in hippocampal plasticity were age dependent, appearing at CA1 synapses several weeks before they were observed in the dentate gyrus. Deficits in synaptic plasticity at CA1 synapses occurred before an overt phenotype. This suggests that altered synaptic plasticity contributes to the pre-symptomatic changes in cognition reported in human carriers of the Huntington' disease gene. The temporal and regional changes in synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus mirror the appearance of neuronal intranuclear inclusions, suggesting a relationship between polyglutamine aggregation and dysfunction.},

PSA-NCAM immunoreactive neurons have also been described outside this layer in humans, where they are severely reduced in schizophrenic brains. Given this important clinical implication, we were interested in finding whether similar neurons existed in the adult rat hippocampus and to characterize their distribution, morphology and phenotype. PSA-NCAM immunocytochemistry reveals labeled neurons in the subiculum, fimbria, alveus, hilus, and stratum oriens, lucidum and radiatum of CA3 and CA1. They are mainly distributed in the ventral hippocampus, and have polygonal or fusiform somata with multipolar or bipolar morphology. These neurons show long straight dendrites, which reach several strata and even enter the fimbria and the alveus. These dendrites are often varicose, appear devoid of excrescences and apparently do not show spines. Most of these neurons display GABA immunoreactivity and further analysis has shown that a subpopulation expresses calretinin, but not somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, parvalbumin, calbindin or NADPH diaphorase. Our study demonstrates that there is an important subpopulation of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive neurons, many of which can be considered interneurons, outside the rat granule cell layer, probably homologous to those described in the human hippocampus. The presence of the polysialylated form of NCAM in these neurons could indicate that they are undergoing continuous remodeling during adulthood and may have an important role in hippocampal structural plasticity.},

  Abstract                 = {Doublecortin (DCX) is a protein required for normal neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex, where it is widely expressed in both radially and tangentially migrating neuroblasts. Moreover, it has been observed in the adult rostral migratory stream, which contains the neuronal precursors traveling to the olfactory bulb. We have performed DCX immunocytochemistry in the adult rat brain to identify precisely the neuronal populations expressing this protein. Our observations confirm the presence of DCX immunoreactive cells with the characteristic morphology of migrating neuroblasts in the subventricular zone, rostral migratory stream and the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. We have also found putative migratory cells expressing DCX in regions were no adult neuronal migration has been described, as the corpus callosum, the piriform cortex layer III/endopiriform nucleus and the striatum. Surprisingly, many cells with the phenotype of differentiated neurons were DCX immunoreactive; e.g. certain granule neurons in the hilar border of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, some neuronal types in the piriform cortex layer II, granule and periglomerular neurons in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, and isolated cells in the striatum. Almost all DCX immunoreactive cells also express the polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule and have a similar distribution to rat collapsin receptor-mediated protein-4, two molecules involved in neuronal structural plasticity. Given these results, we hypothesize that DCX expression in differentiated neurons could be related to its capacity for microtubule reorganization and that this fact could be linked to axonal outgrowth or synaptogenesis.},

Because the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) has been implicated in memory consolidation in the hippocampus and temporal cortex, we have studied in detail the expression of this molecule in the adult rat amygdala with an antibody against PSA-NCAM. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of PSA-NCAM in the adult rat amygdala. Immunoreactive somata and processes are abundant in the amygdalo-hippocampal transition area, central nucleus, intra-amygdaloid bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior and posterior cortical nuclei, periamygdaloid cortex and medial nucleus of the amygdala. In addition PSA-NCAM immunoreactive neuronal somata and processes exist in the lateral, basal and accessory basal nuclei, anterior amygdaloid area and amygdalo-striatal area. The presence of this molecule in areas that receive olfactory or vomeronasal input could reflect the intrinsic plasticity of these chemosensory systems. PSA-NCAM expression in the lateral amygdala could indicate its participation in the plastic events that lead to the generation of emotional memories such as those related to fear conditioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Stress and stress-related hormones induce structural changes in neurons of the adult CNS. Neurons in the hippocampus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex undergo neurite remodeling after chronic stress. In the hippocampus some of these effects can be mimicked with chronic administration of adrenal steroids. These changes in neuronal structure may be mediated by certain molecules related to plastic events such as the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM). The expression of PSA-NCAM persists in the adult hippocampus and it is up-regulated after chronic stress. The piriform cortex also displays considerable levels of PSA-NCAM during adulthood and indirect evidence suggests that it may also be the target of stress and stress related-hormones. Using immunohistochemistry we have studied the expression of PSA-NCAM and doublecortin (DCX; another protein implicated in neuronal structural plasticity) in the piriform cortex of adult rats subjected either to 21 days of chronic restraint stress or to oral corticosterone administration during the same period. Our results indicate that chronic stress and chronic corticosterone administration have differential effects on the expression of PSA-NCAM and DCX. While chronic stress increases the number of PSA-NCAM- and DCX-immunoreactive cells in the piriform cortex layer II, chronic corticosterone administration decreases these numbers. These findings indicate that stress and adrenal steroids affect the piriform cortex and suggest that in this region, as in the hippocampus, they may induce structural changes. This is a potential mechanism by which stress and corticosterone modulate functions of this limbic region, such as its participation in olfactory memory.},

  abstract  = {The rat collapsin response-mediated protein 4 (rCRMP-4) is a member of a family of proteins that are involved in axonal growth. It is found transiently in postmitotic neurons, such as those that are generated in the adult hippocampus. The authors used immunocytochemistry to investigate whether areas of the rat central nervous system (CNS) that retain postnatal neurogenesis express this protein. They found pronounced rCRMP-4 immunoreactivity in recently generated cells in the dentate granular layer, the subventricular zone, the olfactory bulbs, and the rostral migratory stream, four areas in which the production or migration of neurons occurs in adulthood. However, rCRMP-4 immunoreactivity also is expressed in many other regions of the rat brain in which there is no record of adult neurogenesis or neuronal migration, e.g., in the olfactory glomeruli and in neurons of the cerebral cortex. In the hypothalamus, intensely rCRMP-4-labeled neurons populated the supraoptic, paraventricular, and periventricular nuclei as well as the median eminence and the arcuate nucleus. Immunoreactivity for rCRMP-4 also was present in certain neurons of the interpeduncular nucleus, median raphe, superior colliculus, and scattered granule cerebellar neurons. Many of these regions are known to display axonal outgrowth and/or synaptic rearrangement in adulthood and to coexpress the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule. Thus, the results of this study suggest that rCRMP-4 expression in the CNS is associated with cells that are migrating or are undergoing axonal growth. Nevertheless, small, rCRMP-4-immunoreactive cells were seen throughout the brain.

  abstract    = {In medical research analyses, continuous variables are often converted into categoric variables by grouping values into >=2 categories. The simplicity achieved by creating >=2 artificial groups has a cost: Grouping may create rather than avoid problems. In particular, dichotomization leads to a considerable loss of power and incomplete correction for confounding factors. The use of data-derived "optimal" cut-points can lead to serious bias and should at least be tested on independent observations to assess their validity. Both problems are illustrated by the way the results of a registry on unruptured intracranial aneurysms are commonly used. Extreme caution should restrict the application of such results to clinical decision-making. Categorization of continuous data, especially dichotomization, is unnecessary for statistical analysis. Continuous explanatory variables should be left alone in statistical models.},

As such, statistical approaches have traditionally focused on testing specific predictions based upon well-focused hypotheses. However, neuroscience data are often derived from repeated measurements and stimulus type presentations with a limited number of subjects, some of which may have incomplete data per subject. Here we provide an introduction to a group of diverse and powerful statistical approaches, which we term the '5 Ms', which have been successfully used in other fields of biological research facing similar constraints. Specifically, we detail how M1: meta-analysis can combine, reconcile, and analyse between- and within-study results, M2: mixed-effects modelling is beneficial through replacing statistical tests involving pseudoreplication, M3: multiple imputation may be used to account for the biases caused by missing data arising from incomplete experimental protocols, and M4: model averaging from information-theoretic approaches allows to discriminate among alternative functional hypotheses. We also provide a brief introduction to Bayesian statistics using M5: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Taken together, these approaches provide neuroscientists with a robust statistical toolbox containing elements that alleviate some of the analytical constraints generated by limited sample sizes, repeated subject use, and incomplete replicates of experimental manipulation.},

We therefore study laws of behavioral organization, specifically how resting and active periods are interwoven throughout daily life, using objective criteria, and first discover that identical laws hold both for healthy humans subject to the full complexity of daily life, and wild-type mice subject to maximum environmental constraints. We find that active period durations with physical activity counts successively above a predefined threshold, when rescaled with individual means, follow a universal stretched exponential (gamma-type) cumulative distribution, while resting period durations below the threshold obey a universal power-law cumulative distribution with identical parameter values for both of the mammalian species. Further, by analyzing the behavioral organization of mice with a circadian clock gene (Period2) eliminated, and humans suffering from major depressive disorders, we find significantly lower parameter values (power-law scaling exponents) for the resting period durations in both these cases. Such a universality and breakdown of the behavioral organization of mice and humans, revealed through objective measures, is expected to facilitate the understanding of the molecular basis of the pathophysiology of neurobehavioral diseases, including depression, and lay the foundations for formulating a range of neuropsychiatric behavioral disorder models.},

We developed a generally applicable tetanus toxin-based method for transgenic mice that permits inducible and reversible inhibition of synaptic transmission and applied it to the trisynaptic pathway while preserving transmission in the monosynaptic pathway. We found that synaptic output from CA3 in the trisynaptic pathway is dispensable and the short monosynaptic pathway is sufficient for incremental spatial learning. In contrast, the full trisynaptic pathway containing CA3 is required for rapid one-trial contextual learning, for pattern completion-based memory recall, and for spatial tuning of CA1 cells.},

  abstract    = {Early life stress (ES) increases vulnerability to psychopathology and impairs cognition in adulthood. These ES-induced deficits are associated with lasting changes in hippocampal plasticity. Detailed information on the neurobiological basis, the onset, and progression of such changes and their sex-specificity is currently lacking but is required to tailor specific intervention strategies. Here, we use a chronic ES mouse model based on limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal day (P) 2-9 to investigate; (1) if ES leads to impairments in hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in adulthood and (2) if these alterations are paralleled by changes in developmental and/or adult hippocampal neurogenesis. ES increased developmental neurogenesis (proliferation and differentiation) in the dentate gyrus (DG) at P9, and the number of immature (NeurD1(+)) cells migrating postnatally from the secondary dentate matrix, indicating prompt changes in DG structure in both sexes. ES lastingly reduced DG volume and the long-term survival of developmentally born neurons in both sexes at P150. In adult male mice only, ES reduced survival of adult-born neurons (BrdU/NeuN(+) cells), while proliferation (Ki67(+)) and differentiation (DCX(+)) were unaffected. These changes correlated with impaired performance in all learning and memory tasks used here. In contrast, in female mice, despite early alterations in developmental neurogenesis, no lasting changes were present in adult neurogenesis after ES and the cognitive impairments were less prominent and only apparent in some cognitive tasks. We further show that, although neurogenesis and cognition correlate positively, only the hippocampus-dependent functions depend on changes in neurogenesis, whereas cognitive functions that are not exclusively hippocampus-dependent do not. This study indicates that chronic ES has lasting consequences on hippocampal structure and function in mice and suggests that male mice are more susceptible to ES than females. Unraveling the mechanisms that underlie the persistent ES-induced effects may have clinical implications for treatments to counteract ES-induced deficits.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), aside from its classic neurotrophic role in development and survival of neurons, has been shown to be involved in modification and plasticity of central synapses. In mice with BDNF gene deletion (BDNF+/-), deficits in synaptic transmission are often observed but are reversed readily by administration of BDNF, suggesting its acute effect. In support, blockade of BDNF signaling in wild-type hippocampal slices by TrkB-IgG closely reproduces synaptic alterations observed in BDNF+/- mice. We demonstrate that in BDNF+/- mice, lateral olfactory tract (LOT) synapses exhibit decreased release probability of glutamate, suggested by increased paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), as well as by slower blocking rate of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by MK-801 in the pyramidal neurons of the piriform cortex. The changes in PPF were not mimicked in wild-type mice by acute blockade of BDNF signaling by TkrB-IgG. These data imply that BDNF deficit during development might lead to chronic changes of excitatory transmission in LOT synapses. Modification of the LOT synapses in BDNF+/- mice was associated with altered inhibitory drive onto the mitral cells from the granule and glomerular neurons, which in turn exhibited decreased renewal rate compared to that in wild-type mice. Taken together, these data suggest that BDNF deficiency can have both acute and more permanent effects on synaptic function, particularly when BDNF signaling is compromised during the early stages of brain development. In the latter case, altered synaptic properties in BDNF+/- mice could be secondary to other complex changes in the brain, e.g., cell survival/proliferation.},

  Abstract                 = {If the scientist needs to contact the animal facility after any study to inquire about husbandry details, this represents a lost opportunity, which can ultimately interfere with the study results and their interpretation. There is a clear tendency for authors to describe methodological procedures down to the smallest detail, but at the same time to provide minimal information on animals and their husbandry. Controlling all major variables as far as possible is the key issue when establishing an experimental design. The other common mechanism affecting study results is a change in the variation. Factors causing bias or variation changes are also detectable within husbandry. Our lives and the lives of animals are governed by cycles: the seasons, the reproductive cycle, the weekend-working days, the cage change/room sanitation cycle, and the diurnal rhythm. Some of these may be attributable to routine husbandry, and the rest are cycles, which may be affected by husbandry procedures. Other issues to be considered are consequences of in-house transport, restrictions caused by caging, randomization of cage location, the physical environment inside the cage, the acoustic environment audible to animals, olfactory environment, materials in the cage, cage complexity, feeding regimens, kinship, and humans. Laboratory animal husbandry issues are an integral but underappreciated part of investigators' experimental design, which if ignored can cause major interference with the results. All researchers should familiarize themselves with the current routine animal care of the facility serving them, including their capabilities for the monitoring of biological and physicochemical environment.},

Current empirically derived guidelines are based on the area provided per mouse depending on body weight as documented in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The current study aimed to provide a more scientific basis for housing density by examining the response of C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice to increased housing density from weaning to 5 mo of age, to determine those parameters most useful for future larger-scale studies. A wide range of phenotypic characteristics--including growth rate, body composition, hematology, serum biochemistry, hormone and metabolite measurements, in-cage telemetry, behavior, and cage microenvironment--was examined at various time points. The parameters showing greatest changes were: growth rate, which was significantly reduced in animals at the highest density; adrenal gland size, the proportion of adrenal cortex, and concentration of fecal corticosterone metabolites, all of which were increased at higher densities; and anxiety and barbering, which were more pronounced at higher densities. Cage microenvironment deteriorated with increasing density, but the increases in measured parameters were small, and their biologic impact, if any, was not apparent. The current findings indicate that mouse housing density can be increased 50\% to 100\% above the current recommendations (as floor area per mouse) with no or few apparent affects on mouse overall wellbeing. However, weight gain, fecal corticosterone metabolite levels, and barbering differed significantly with housing density and therefore are suggested as good measures of the response to alterations in housing.},

  abstract    = {In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a statistical test on their difference. In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P < 0.05) but the other is not (P > 0.05). We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous procedure is particularly beguiling.},

These questions were studied by comparing HD patients and controls (matched for age, gender, and education) on absolute detection, intensity discrimination, quality discrimination, short-term recognition memory, and lexical- and picture-based identification for odor. Taste or vision were used as comparison modalities. The results suggest that whereas odor-recognition memory is not affected in patients with HD, these patients have impaired olfactory functioning with respect to absolute detection, intensity discrimination, quality discrimination, and identification. The three latter impairments were significantly explained by poor detection sensitivity. Odor identification was the function most affected.},

  Abstract                 = {Reaching tasks are popular tools for investigating the neural mechanisms of motor skill learning and recovery from brain damage in rodents, but there is considerable unexplained variability across studies using these tasks. We investigated whether breeder, batch effects, experimenter, time of year, weight and other factors contribute to differences in the acquisition and performance of a skilled reaching task, the single pellet retrieval task, in adult male Long-Evans hooded rats. First, we retrospectively analyzed task acquisition and performance in rats from different breeding colonies that were used in several studies spanning a 3 year period in our laboratory. Second, we compared reaching variables in age-matched rats from different breeders that were trained together as a batch by the same experimenters. All rats had received daily training on the reaching task until they reached a criterion of successful reaches per attempt. We found significant breeder-dependent differences in learning rate and final performance level. This was found even when age-matched rats from different breeders were trained together by the same experimenters. There was also significant batch-to-batch variability within rats from the same breeder trained by the same experimenter. Other factors, including weight, paw preference and the experimenter, were not as strong or consistent in their contributions to differences across studies. The breeder and batch effects found within the same rat strain may reflect genetic and environmental influences on the neural substrates of motor skill learning. This is an important consideration when comparing baseline performance across studies and for controlling variability within studies.},

Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

More caudal SVZ (cSVZ) neural progenitors migrate to the hippocampus after ischemic injury and contribute to CA1 pyramidal cell regeneration. Because SE also damages the hippocampus, we examined the effects of SE on cSVZ precursors. SE was induced in adult rats with pilocarpine, and cell proliferation in cSVZ and hippocampus was examined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and retroviral reporter labeling. Neural precursors were assayed by immunostaining for specfic markers between 1 and 35 days after SE. BrdU-positive cells labeled prior to SE markedly increased in numbers within 1-2 weeks in the cSVZ and infracallosal region, but not in the corpus callosum. Doublecortin-, polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule-, and TUC-4 (TOAD/Ulip/CRMP family-4)-immunostained cells with migrating morphology increased with a similar time course after SE and extended from the cSVZ to CA1 and CA3 regions. Retroviral reporters injected into the cSVZ of controls showed labeled cells with oligodendroglial morphology located in the cSVZ and corpus callosum; when injected 2 days prior to SE, many more reporter-labeled cells appeared several weeks later and were located in the cSVZ, corpus callosum, and hippocampus. Labeled cells showed glial morphologies and expressed astrocyte or oligodendrocyte markers. Neither BrdU- nor retroviral reporter-labeled cells coexpressed neuronal markers in controls or pilocarpine-treated rats. These results indicate that SE increases cSVZ gliogenesis and attracts newly generated glia to regions of hippocampal damage. Further study of seizure-induced gliogenesis may provide insight into mechanisms of adult neural progenitor regulation and epileptogenesis.},

The effects of injury on this neurogenic region of the mature brain are poorly understood. To determine whether seizure-induced injury modulates SVZ neurogenesis, we induced status epilepticus (SE) in adult rats by systemic chemoconvulsant administration and examined patterns of neuronal precursor proliferation and migration in the SVZ-olfactory bulb pathway. Within 1-2 weeks after pilocarpine-induced SE, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and Nissl staining increased in the rostral forebrain SVZ. These changes were associated with an increase in cells expressing antigenic markers of SVZ neuroblasts 2-3 weeks after prolonged seizures. At these same time points the RMS expanded and contained more proliferating cells and immature neurons. BrdU labeling and stereotactic injections of retroviral reporters into the SVZ showed that prolonged seizures also increased neuroblast migration to the olfactory bulb and induced a portion of the neuronal precursors to exit the RMS prematurely. These findings indicate that SE expands the SVZ neuroblast population and alters neuronal precursor migration in the adult rat forebrain. Identification of the mechanisms underlying the response of neural progenitors to seizure-induced injury may help to advance brain regenerative therapies by using either transplanted or endogenous neural precursor cells.},

It is known that batch effects can alter or obscure the set of significant results and biological conclusions in high-throughput studies. Here we examine the impact of batch effects on predictors built from genomic technologies. To investigate batch effects, we collected publicly available gene expression measurements with known outcomes, and estimated batches using date. Using these data we show (1) the impact of batch effects on prediction depends on the correlation between outcome and batch in the training data, and (2) removing expression measurements most affected by batch before building predictors may improve the accuracy of those predictors. These results suggest that (1) training sets should be designed to minimize correlation between batches and outcome, and (2) methods for identifying batch-affected probes should be developed to improve prediction results for studies with high correlation between batches and outcome.},

In the present study, we characterized the neurogenic potential in the piriform cortex of adult rats.

Many of the cells exhibited a pyramidal cell morphology. The lack of 5'-bromodeoxyuridine/NeuN-labeled cells 12 weeks after 5'-bromodeoxyuridine administration argued against long-term survival of newborn neurons in the piriform cortex.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: To determine which approach to assessment of evidence in data - statistical tests or likelihood ratios - comes closest to the interpretation of evidence by untrained medical students. METHODS: Empirical study of medical students (N = 842), untrained in statistical inference or in the interpretation of diagnostic tests. They were asked to interpret a hypothetical diagnostic test, presented in four versions that differed in the distributions of test scores in diseased and non-diseased populations. Each student received only one version. The intuitive application of the statistical test approach would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis of no disease in version A, and to accepting the null in version B. Application of the likelihood ratio approach led to opposite conclusions - against the disease in A, and in favour of disease in B. Version C tested the importance of the p-value (A: 0.04 versus C: 0.08) and version D the importance of the likelihood ratio (C: 1/4 versus D: 1/8). RESULTS: In version A, 7.5\% concluded that the result was in favour of disease (compatible with p value), 43.6\% ruled against the disease (compatible with likelihood ratio), and 48.9\% were undecided. In version B, 69.0\% were in favour of disease (compatible with likelihood ratio), 4.5\% against (compatible with p value), and 26.5\% undecided. Increasing the p value from 0.04 to 0.08 did not change the results. The change in the likelihood ratio from 1/4 to 1/8 increased the proportion of non-committed responses. CONCLUSIONS: Most untrained medical students appear to interpret evidence from data in a manner that is compatible with the use of likelihood ratios.},

The methodological rigor of each individual study was evaluated using 5 criteria derived from the STAIR guidelines. The adequacy of the preclinical "package" for each drug was then evaluated by combining the results of all studies for each drug to determine which of a further 5 STAIR criteria were met before moving forward from animal to human studies.Our search yielded 13 agents of which 10 had published data in peer-reviewed journals. There is substantial within-drug variability in the quality of preclinical studies as well as substantial variation in the completeness of the collective preclinical literature for different drugs. There has been little or no improvement in the quality of animal studies since NXY-059, and current agents have not been subjected to a more complete preclinical evaluation.There is significant heterogeneity in the quality of animal testing for neuroprotective agents in stroke.

Furthermore, numbers of such cells were unaltered in response to seizures in both wild-type and R6/2 mice.

There are no treatments to halt or reverse the disease. Mammalian neurogenesis persists into adulthood in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. In 2001, our laboratory published the hypothesis that neurogenesis is impaired in neurodegenerative diseases and that this may contribute to disease progression. Since then, it has been shown that neurogenesis is reduced in the DG of transgenic HD mice but increased in the SVZ of HD patients. We sought to characterize neurogenesis further. We found that, in the DG of the transgenic R6/2 mouse model of HD, newborn cell proliferation and morphology, but not differentiation or survival, was compromised. In R6/2 mice, neurogenesis failed to upregulate in the DG in response to seizures. Basal SVZ neurogenesis was similar between R6/2 mice and their wild-type littermates. There was no difference in the in vitro growth of adult neural precursor cells (NPCs) between genotypes. These results suggest that abnormal neurogenesis in the R6/2 mouse is not attributable to an intrinsic impairment of the NPC itself but is attributable to the environment in which the cell is located.},

Eight of 1000 small molecules tested enhanced neuron formation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Among these was an aminopropyl carbazole, designated P7C3, endowed with favorable pharmacological properties. In vivo studies gave evidence that P7C3 exerts its proneurogenic activity by protecting newborn neurons from apoptosis. Mice missing the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3) are devoid of hippocampal neurogenesis and display malformation and electrophysiological dysfunction of the dentate gyrus. Prolonged administration of P7C3 to npas3(-/-) mice corrected these deficits by normalizing levels of apoptosis of newborn hippocampal neurons. Prolonged administration of P7C3 to aged rats also enhanced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, impeded neuron death, and preserved cognitive capacity as a function of terminal aging. PAPERCLIP:},

Possible advantages of this approach compared to the use of linear contrasts are discussed. It is concluded that a well-chosen model can often considerably simplify the analysis and lead to useful statistical inferences.

  abstract  = {The 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine and the adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) both increase the proliferation of progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus and also have antidepressant activity. This paper explores the combined ability of fluoxetine and DHEA to affect this process in the dentate gyrus of adult rats. We show that DHEA can render an otherwise ineffective dose of fluoxetine (2.5 mg/kg) able to increase progenitor cell proliferation to the same extent as doses four times higher (10 mg/kg). This synergistic action does not appear to be mediated by alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression; or by TrkB, mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid, or 5-HT (5HT1A) receptor expression in the dentate gyrus; or by altered levels of plasma corticosterone. In a second experiment, the synergism between DHEA and fluoxetine was replicated. Furthermore, flattening the diurnal rhythm of plasma corticosterone by implanting additional corticosterone pellets s.c. prevented the effect of fluoxetine on progenitor cell division. This was not overcome by simultaneous treatment with DHEA, despite the latter's reported anti-glucocorticoid actions. The cellular mechanism for the potentiating action of DHEA on the pro- proliferative effects of fluoxetine in the adult hippocampus remains to be revealed. Since altered neurogenesis has been linked to the onset or recovery from depression, one consequence of these results is to suggest DHEA as a useful adjunct therapy for depression.},

  abstract    = {It was reported that oseltamivir (Tamiflu) absorption was mediated by human peptide transporter (hPEPT) 1. Understanding the exact mechanism(s) of absorption is important in the context of drug-drug and diet-drug interactions. Hence, we investigated the mechanism governing the intestinal absorption of oseltamivir and its active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) in wild-type [Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1] and hPEPT1-transfected cells (CHO-PEPT1), in pharmacokinetic studies in juvenile and adult rats, and in healthy volunteers. In vitro cell culture studies showed that the intracellular accumulation of oseltamivir and its carboxylate into CHO-PEPT1 and CHO-K1 was always similar under a variety of experimental conditions, demonstrating that these compounds are not substrates of hPEPT1. Furthermore, neither oseltamivir nor its active metabolite was capable of inhibiting Gly-Sar uptake in CHO-PEPT1 cells. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in juvenile and adult rats showed that the disposition of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate, after oral administration of oseltamivir, was sensitive to the feed status but insensitive to the presence of milk and Gly-Sar. Moreover, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate exhibited significantly higher exposure in rats under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. In humans, oral dosing after a high-fat meal resulted in a statistically significant but moderate lower exposure than after an overnight fasting. This change has no clinical implications. Taken together, the results do not implicate either rat Pept1 or hPEPT1 in the oral absorption of oseltamivir.},

We have studied 9 symptomatic Huntington's disease patients (age = 46.8 +/- 4.7 years; mean +/- SD) and 10 premanifest Huntington's disease gene carriers (age = 41.9 +/- 8.2 years; mean +/- SD). RAC and PK findings for these subjects were compared with those of a group of normal controls (RAC, n = 9; PK, n = 10). In the symptomatic Huntington's disease group, we found a significant decrease (P = 0.0012) in mean hypothalamic RAC binding potential (BP) and a significant increase in mean hypothalamic PK BP (P = 0.0008). Similarly, a significant decrease (P = 0.0143) in mean hypothalamic RAC BP and a significant increase in mean hypothalamic PK BP (P = 0.0057) were observed in the premanifest Huntington's disease group. Hypothalamic RAC and PK BP values correlated with each other in combined Huntington's disease groups (r = -0.6180, P = 0.0048) but not with striatal RAC and PK BP values. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, significant D(2) receptor loss and microglia activation in the hypothalamus of Huntington's disease. These pathological changes occur very early in the course of the disease and may partly explain the development of commonly reported symptoms in Huntington's disease including progressive weight loss, alterations in sexual behaviour and disturbances in the wake-sleep cycle.},

We use here a retroviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein that only labels dividing cells, and that can be visualized in live hippocampal slices. We report that newly generated cells in the adult mouse hippocampus have neuronal morphology and can display passive membrane properties, action potentials and functional synaptic inputs similar to those found in mature dentate granule cells.

Neither belief is empirically based. In a meta-analysis of 293 articles, behavioral, morphological, physiological, and molecular traits were monitored in male mice and females tested without regard to estrous cycle stage; variability was not significantly greater in females than males for any endpoint and was substantially greater in males for several traits. Group housing of mice increased variability in both males and females by 37\%. Utilization of female mice in neuroscience research does not require monitoring of the estrous cycle. The prevalence of sex differences at all levels of biological organization, and limitations in generalizing findings obtained with males to females, argue for the routine inclusion of female rodents in most research protocols.},

  abstract  = {In vivo visualization of endogenous neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is crucial to advance stem cell research and will be essential to assure safety and efficacy of neurogenesis based therapies. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), i.e. spatially resolved spectroscopy in vivo, is a highly promising technique to investigate endogenous neurogenesis noninvasively. A distinct feature in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, i.e. a lipid signal at 1.28 ppm, was recently attributed specifically to NPCs in vitro and to neurogenic regions in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that, although this 1.28 ppm biomarker is present in NPC cultures, it is not specific for the latter. The 1.28 ppm marker was also evident in mesenchymal stem cells and in non-stem cell lines. Moreover, it was absent in freshly isolated NPCs but appeared under conditions favouring growth arrest or apoptosis, it is initiated by induction of apoptosis and correlates with the appearance of mobile lipid droplets. Thus, although the 1.28 ppm signal cannot be considered as a specific biomarker for NPCs, it might still serve as a sensor for processes that are tightly associated with neurogenesis and NPCs in vivo, such as apoptosis or stem cell quiescence. This, however, requires further experimental evidence. The present work clearly urges the identification of additional bio-markers for NPCs and for neurogenesis. ______________________________________________________________________________ Author contributions: P.R.: Collection and/or assembly of data, Data analysis and interpretation, Manuscript writing; S.C.: Data analysis and interpretation; S.P.: Collection and/or assembly of data; F.R.: Collection and/or assembly of data, Data analysis and interpretation; M.K.: Collection and/or assembly of data, Data analysis and interpretation; B.L.: Collection and/or assembly of data, Data analysis and interpretation; W.K.: Data analysis and interpretation; U.B.: Conception and design; H.R.K.: Conception and design; L.A.: Conception and design, Data analysis and interpretation, Manuscript writing.},

  Abstract                 = {Claims about the diagnostic or prognostic accuracy of markers often prove disappointing when "discrimination" found between cancers versus normals is due to bias, a systematic difference between compared groups. This article describes a framework to help simplify and organize current problems in marker research by focusing on the role of specimens as a source of bias in observational research and using that focus to address problems and improve reliability. The central idea is that the "fundamental comparison" in research about markers (ie, the comparison done to assess whether a marker discriminates) involves two distinct processes that are "connected" by specimens. If subject selection (first process) creates baseline inequality between groups being compared, then laboratory analysis of specimens (second process) may erroneously find positive results. Although both processes are important, subject selection more fundamentally influences the quality of marker research, because it can hardwire bias into all comparisons in a way that cannot be corrected by any refinement in laboratory analysis. An appreciation of the separateness of these two processes-and placing investigators with appropriate expertise in charge of each-may increase the reliability of research about cancer biomarkers.},

  abstract  = {Doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule-associated phosphoprotein, has been recently utilized as a marker of newly born neurons in the adult dentate gyrus (DG). Nonetheless, it is unknown whether DCX exclusively labels newly formed neurons, as certain granule cells with the phenotype of differentiated neurons express DCX. We addressed the authenticity of DCX as a marker of new neurons in the adult DG by quantifying cells that are positive for 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), DCX and both BrdU and DCX in hippocampal tissues of adult rats treated with daily injections of BrdU for 12 consecutive days. We provide new evidence that neurons visualized with DCX immunostaining in the adult rat DG are new neurons that are predominantly born during the 12 days before euthanasia. This is confirmed by the robust expression of BrdU in 90\% of DCX-positive neurons in the DG of animals injected with BrdU for 12 days. Furthermore, DCX expression is specific to newly generated healthy neurons, as virtually all DCX-positive cells express early neuronal antigens but lack antigens specific to glia, undifferentiated cells or apoptotic cells. As DCX expression is also robust in the dendrites, DCX immunocytochemistry of thicker sections facilitates quantification of the dendritic growth in newly born neurons. Thus, both absolute number and dendritic growth of new neurons that are generated in the adult DG over a 12-day period can be quantified reliably with DCX immunostaining. This could be particularly useful for analysing changes in dentate neurogenesis in human hippocampal tissues as a function of ageing or neurodegenerative diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients are deprived of sleep and its potential healing qualities, although many receive medications to promote sleep. No one has adequately evaluated holistic nonpharmacological techniques designed to promote sleep in critical care practice. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of (1) a back massage and (2) combined muscle relaxation, mental imagery, and a music audiotape on the sleep of older men with a cardiovascular illness who were hospitalized in a critical care unit. METHODS: Sixty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to a 6-minute back massage (n=24); a teaching session on relaxation and a 7.5-minute audiotape at bedtime consisting of muscle relaxation, mental imagery, and relaxing background music (n=28); or the usual nursing care (controls, n=17). Polysomnography was used to measure 1 night of sleep for each patients. Sleep efficiency index was the primary variable of interest. One-way analysis of variance was used to test for difference in the index among the 3 groups. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics showed improved quality of sleep among the back-massage group. Initial analysis showed a significant difference among the 3 groups in sleep efficiency index. Post hoc testing with the Duncan procedure indicated a significant difference between the back-massage group and the control group; patients in the back-massage group slept more than 1 hour long than patients in the control group. However, the variance was significantly different among the 3 groups, and reanalysis of data with only 17 subjects in each group revealed no difference among groups (P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: Back massage is useful for promoting sleep in critically ill older men.},

However, mounting evidence indicates that even subtle differences in laboratory or test conditions can lead to conflicting test outcomes. Because experimental treatments may interact with environmental conditions, experiments conducted under highly standardized conditions may reveal local 'truths' with little external validity. We review this hypothesis here and present a proof of principle based on data from a multilaboratory study on behavioral differences between inbred mouse strains. Our findings suggest that environmental standardization is a cause of, rather than a cure for, poor reproducibility of experimental outcomes. Environmental standardization can contribute to spurious and conflicting findings in the literature and unnecessary animal use. This conclusion calls for research into practicable and effective ways of systematic environmental heterogenization to attenuate these scientific, economic and ethical costs.},

P-values are often judged according to whether they lie beneath traditionally accepted thresholds (< 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.001, < 0.0001); we examine how these thresholds influence the distribution of reported absolute P-values in published scientific papers, the majority in biological sciences. We collected published P-values from three leading journals, and summarized their distribution using the frequencies falling across and within these four threshold values between 0.05 and 0. These published frequencies were then fitted to three complementary null models which allowed us to predict the expected proportions of P-values in the top and bottom half of each inter-threshold interval (i.e. those lying below, as opposed to above, each P-value threshold). Statistical comparison of these predicted proportions, against those actually observed, provides the first empirical evidence for a remarkable excess of probability values being cited on, or just below, each threshold relative to the smoothed theoretical distributions. The pattern is consistent across thresholds and journals, and for whichever theoretical approach used to generate our expected proportions. We discuss this novel finding and its implications for solving the problems of publication bias and selective reporting in evolutionary biology.},

They considered publication bias a problem in animal research (7 (5 to 8)) and thought that about 50\% (32-70) of animal experiments are published. Employees (n = 21) of for-profit organizations estimated that 10\% (5 to 50) are published. Lack of statistical significance (4 (4 to 5)), technical problems (4 (3 to 4)), supervisors (4 (3 to 5)) and peer reviewers (4 (3 to 5)) were considered important reasons for non-publication (all on 5-point scales). Respondents thought that mandatory publication of study protocols and results, or the reasons why no results were obtained, may increase scientific progress but expected increased bureaucracy. These opinions did not depend on size of the animal used, seniority of the respondent or type of research.Non-publication of "negative" results appears to be prevalent in laboratory animal research. If statistical significance is indeed a main driver of publication, the collective literature on animal experimentation will be biased. This will impede the performance of valid literature syntheses. Effective, yet efficient systems should be explored to counteract selective reporting of laboratory animal research.},

  abstract  = {A quiet methodological revolution, a modeling revolution, has occurred over the past several decades, almost without discussion. In contrast, the 20th century ended with contentious argument over the utility of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The NHST controversy may have been at least partially irrelevant, because in certain ways the modeling revolution obviated the NHST argument. I begin with a history of NHST and modeling and their relation to one another. Next, I define and illustrate principles involved in developing and evaluating mathematical models. Following, I discuss the difference between using statistical procedures within a rule-based framework and building mathematical models from a scientific epistemology. Only the former is treated carefully in most psychology graduate training. The pedagogical implications of this imbalance and the revised pedagogy required to account for the modeling revolution are described. To conclude, I discuss how attention to modeling implies shifting statistical practice in certain progressive ways. The epistemological basis of statistics has moved away from being a set of procedures, applied mechanistically, and moved toward building and evaluating statistical and scientific models.},

Determination of neurite outgrowth in cell culture is a widely used approach to investigate these phenomena. This is generally done by a time consuming tracing of individual neurites and their branches. We have used stereological principles to determine the length of neurites. The total neuritic length per cell was estimated by counting the number of intersections between neurites and test lines of an unbiased counting frame superimposed on images of cell cultures obtained by conventional computer-assisted microscopy. The absolute length, L, of neurites per cell was subsequently estimated from the number of neurite intersections, I, per cell by means of the equation L=(pid/2)I describing the relationship between the number of neurite intersections and the vertical distance, d, between the test lines used. When measuring neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons, data obtained by counting neuritic intersections correlated statistically significantly with data obtained using a conventional tracing technique. However, information was acquired more efficiently using the stereological approach. Thus, using the described set-up, the stereological procedure was approximately five times less time consuming than the conventional method based on neurite tracing. The study shows that stereological estimation of neuritic length provides a precise and efficient method for the study of neurite outgrowth in cultures of primary neurons and cell lines.},

OBJECTIVE: To fully characterize the morphometric changes that occur in vivo in HD. METHODS: High-resolution 1.5 mm T1-weighted coronal scans were acquired from 18 individuals in early to mid-stages of HD and 18 healthy age-matched controls. Cortical and subcortical gray and white matter were segmented using a semiautomated intensity contour-mapping algorithm. General linear models for correlated data of the volumes of brain regions were used to compare groups, controlling for age, education, handedness, sex, and total brain volumes. RESULTS: Subjects with HD had significant volume reductions in almost all brain structures, including total cerebrum, total white matter, cerebral cortex, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, amygdala, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread degeneration occurs in early to mid-stages of HD, may explain some of the clinical heterogeneity, and may impact future clinical trials.},

The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the "universal null hypothesis" that "chance" serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings.},

Statisticians who developed Bayesian methods thought not, but this wisdom has been challenged by recent simulation results of Yu, Sprenger, Thomas, and Dougherty (2013) and Sanborn and Hills (2013). In this article, I show through simulation that the interpretation of Bayesian quantities does not depend on the stopping rule. Researchers using Bayesian methods may employ optional stopping in their own research and may provide Bayesian analysis of secondary data regardless of the employed stopping rule. I emphasize here the proper interpretation of Bayesian quantities as measures of subjective belief on theoretical positions, the difference between frequentist and Bayesian interpretations, and the difficulty of using frequentist intuition to conceptualize the Bayesian approach.},

We consider in detail issues pertaining to creating just two groups, a common approach in clinical research. We argue that the simplicity achieved is gained at a cost; dichotomization may create rather than avoid problems, notably a considerable loss of power and residual confounding. In addition, the use of a data-derived 'optimal' cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis. Dichotomization of continuous data is unnecessary for statistical analysis and in particular should not be applied to explanatory variables in regression models.},

  Abstract                 = {Polysialic acid (PSA), a homopolymer attached to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), serves as a modulator of cell interactions. Polysialic acid exhibits a highly regulated expression pattern. During embryonic development its abundant expression is closely correlated with axon pathfinding and targeting, and with certain aspects of muscle formation. Its level also can be altered by synaptic activity. During neonatal development and in the adult brain, PSA expression is more restricted, being primarily associated with regions capable of morphological or physiological plasticity. The ability to perturb PSA in vivo by a specific glycosidase and by the creation of NCAM-deficient mice has led to extensive analysis of its biological function. These studies suggest that the primary role of PSA is to promote changes in cell interactions and thereby facilitate plasticity in the structure and function of the nervous system.},

  abstract    = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of neural circuit plasticity that results in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout life. Neurons that arise in adults (adult-born neurons) show heightened synaptic plasticity during their maturation and can account for up to ten per cent of the entire granule cell population. Moreover, levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are increased by interventions that are associated with beneficial effects on cognition and mood, such as learning, environmental enrichment, exercise and chronic treatment with antidepressants. Together, these properties of adult neurogenesis indicate that this process could be harnessed to improve hippocampal functions. However, despite a substantial number of studies demonstrating that adult-born neurons are necessary for mediating specific cognitive functions, as well as some of the behavioural effects of antidepressants, it is unknown whether an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood. Here we show that inducible genetic expansion of the population of adult-born neurons through enhancing their survival improves performance in a specific cognitive task in which two similar contexts need to be distinguished. Mice with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis show normal object recognition, spatial learning, contextual fear conditioning and extinction learning but are more efficient in differentiating between overlapping contextual representations, which is indicative of enhanced pattern separation. Furthermore, stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, when combined with an intervention such as voluntary exercise, produces a robust increase in exploratory behaviour. However, increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis alone does not produce a behavioural response like that induced by anxiolytic agents or antidepressants. Together, our findings suggest that strategies that are designed to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically, by targeting the cell death of adult-born neurons or by other mechanisms, may have therapeutic potential for reversing impairments in pattern separation and dentate gyrus dysfunction such as those seen during normal ageing.},

  abstract    = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the most commonly used statistical methodology in psychology. The probability of achieving a value as extreme or more extreme than the statistic obtained from the data is evaluated, and if it is low enough, the null hypothesis is rejected. However, because common experimental practice often clashes with the assumptions underlying NHST, these calculated probabilities are often incorrect. Most commonly, experimenters use tests that assume that sample sizes are fixed in advance of data collection but then use the data to determine when to stop; in the limit, experimenters can use data monitoring to guarantee that the null hypothesis will be rejected. Bayesian hypothesis testing (BHT) provides a solution to these ills because the stopping rule used is irrelevant to the calculation of a Bayes factor. In addition, there are strong mathematical guarantees on the frequentist properties of BHT that are comforting for researchers concerned that stopping rules could influence the Bayes factors produced. Here, we show that these guaranteed bounds have limited scope and often do not apply in psychological research. Specifically, we quantitatively demonstrate the impact of optional stopping on the resulting Bayes factors in two common situations: (1) when the truth is a combination of the hypotheses, such as in a heterogeneous population, and (2) when a hypothesis is composite-taking multiple parameter values-such as the alternative hypothesis in a t-test. We found that, for these situations, while the Bayesian interpretation remains correct regardless of the stopping rule used, the choice of stopping rule can, in some situations, greatly increase the chance of experimenters finding evidence in the direction they desire. We suggest ways to control these frequentist implications of stopping rules on BHT.},

  abstract    = {Established psychological results have been called into question by demonstrations that statistical significance is easy to achieve, even in the absence of an effect. One often-warned-against practice, choosing when to stop the experiment on the basis of the results, is guaranteed to produce significant results. In response to these demonstrations, Bayes factors have been proposed as an antidote to this practice, because they are invariant with respect to how an experiment was stopped. Should researchers only care about the resulting Bayes factor, without concern for how it was produced? Yu, Sprenger, Thomas, and Dougherty (2014) and Sanborn and Hills (2014) demonstrated that Bayes factors are sometimes strongly influenced by the stopping rules used. However, Rouder (2014) has provided a compelling demonstration that despite this influence, the evidence supplied by Bayes factors remains correct. Here we address why the ability to influence Bayes factors should still matter to researchers, despite the correctness of the evidence. We argue that good frequentist properties mean that results will more often agree with researchers' statistical intuitions, and good frequentist properties control the number of studies that will later be refuted. Both help raise confidence in psychological results.},

  Abstract                 = {Our work with both sheep and mouse models has revealed many of the neural substrates and signalling pathways involved in olfactory recognition memory in the main olfactory system. A distributed neural system is required for initial memory formation and its short-term retention-the olfactory bulb, piriform and entorhinal cortices and hippocampus. Following memory consolidation, after 8 h or so, only the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex appear to be important for effective recall. Similarly, whereas the glutamate-NMDA/AMPA receptor-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP signalling pathway is important for memory formation it is not involved in recall post-consolidation. Here, within the olfactory bulb, up-regulation of class 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors appears to maintain the enhanced sensitivity at the mitral to granule cell synapses required for effective memory recall. Recently we have investigated whether fluctuating sex hormone levels during the oestrous cycle modulate olfactory recognition memory and the different neural substrates and signalling pathways involved. These studies have used two robust models of social olfactory memory in the mouse which either involve social or non social odours (habituation-dishabituation and social transmission of food preference tasks). In both cases significant improvement of learning retention occurs when original learning takes place during the proestrus phase of the ovarian cycle. This is probably the result of oestrogen changes at this time since transgenic mice lacking functional expression of oestrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta, the two main oestrogen receptor sub-types) have shown problems in social recognition. Therefore, oestrogen appears to act at the level of the olfactory bulb by modulating both noradrenaline and the glutamate/NO signalling pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {Mixed-effect models are frequently used to control for the nonindependence of data points, for example, when repeated measures from the same individuals are available. The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type II errors as well.},

It has been shown that production of new hippocampal neurons is necessary for amelioration of stress-induced behavioral changes by antidepressants in animal models of depression. The survival of newly born hippocampal neurons is decreased by chronic psychosocial stress and increased by exposure to enriched environments. These observations suggest the existence of a link between hippocampal neurogenesis, stress-induced behavioral changes, and the beneficial effects of enriched environment. To show causality, we subjected transgenic mice with conditionally suppressed neurogenesis to psychosocial stress followed by environmental enrichment. First, we showed that repeated social defeat coupled with chronic exposure to an aggressor produces robust and quantifiable indices of submissive and depressive-like behaviors; second, subsequent exposure to an enriched environment led to extinction of the submissive phenotype, while animals exposed to an impoverished environment retained the submissive phenotype; and third, enrichment was not effective in reversing the submissive and depressive-like behaviors in transgenic mice lacking neurogenesis. Our data show two main findings. First, living in an enriched environment is highly effective in extinguishing submissive behavioral traits developed during chronic social stress, and second, these effects are critically dependent on adult neurogenesis, indicating that beneficial behavioral adaptations are dependent on intact adult neurogenesis.},

  abstract  = {Quantitative morphology of the CNS has recently undergone major developments. In particular, several new approaches, known as design-based stereologic methods, have become available and have been successfully applied to neuromorphological research. However, much confusion and uncertainty remains about the meaning, implications, and advantages of these design-based stereologic methods. The objective of this review is to provide some clarification. It does not comprise a full description of all stereologic methods available. Rather, it is written by users for users, provides the reader with a guided tour through the relevant literature. It has been the experience of the authors that most neuroscientists potentially interested in design-based stereology need to analyze volumes of brain regions, numbers of cells (neurons, glial cells) within these brain regions, mean volumes (nuclear, perikaryal) of these cells, length densities of linear biological structures such as vessels and nerve fibers within brain regions, and the cytoarchitecture of brain regions (i.e. the spatial distribution of cells within a region of interest). Therefore, a comprehensive introduction to design-based stereologic methods for estimating these parameters is provided. It is demonstrated that results obtained with design-based stereology are representative for the entire brain region of interest, and are independent of the size, shape, spatial orientation, and spatial distribution of the cells to be investigated. Also, it is shown that bias (i.e. systematic error) in results obtained with design-based stereology can be limited to a minimum, and that it is possible to assess the variability of these results. These characteristics establish the advantages of design-based stereologic methods in quantitative neuromorphology.},

  abstract    = {The integrity of RNA molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of RNA extraction. Until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of RNA samples and the ratio of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. The advent of microcapillary electrophoretic RNA separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of RNA samples in an unambiguous way.A method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a Bayesian learning technique. Feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the Bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.This approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic RNA measurements recorded with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes RNA integrity. The resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of RNA quality control that allows the calculation of an RNA integrity number (RIN).Our results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of RNA integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.},

Mice carrying 23 copies of the human SOD1(G93A) transgene are considered the standard model for FALS and ALS therapeutic studies. To date, there have been at least 50 publications describing therapeutic agents that extend the lifespan of this mouse. However, no therapeutic agent besides riluzole has shown corresponding clinical efficacy. We used computer modeling and statistical analysis of 5429 SOD1(G93A) mice from our efficacy studies to quantify the impact of several critical confounding biological variables that must be appreciated and should be controlled for when designing and interpreting efficacy studies. Having identified the most critical of these biological variables, we subsequently instituted parameters for optimal study design in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model. We retested several compounds reported in major animal studies (minocycline, creatine, celecoxib, sodium phenylbutyrate, ceftriaxone, WHI-P131, thalidomide, and riluzole) using this optimal study design and found no survival benefit in the SOD1(G93A) mouse for any compounds (including riluzole) administered by their previously reported routes and doses. The presence of these uncontrolled confounding variables in the screening system, and the failure of these several drugs to demonstrate efficacy in adequately designed and powered repeat studies, leads us to conclude that the majority of published effects are most likely measurements of noise in the distribution of survival means as opposed to actual drug effect. We recommend a minimum study design for this mouse model to best address and manage this inherent noise and to facilitate more significant and reproducible results among all laboratories employing the SOD1(G93A) mouse.},

Achieving this balance of, often conflicting, requirements is a major challenge in drug discovery. Approaches to simultaneously optimizing many factors in a design are broadly described under the term 'multi-parameter optimization' (MPO). In this review, we will describe how MPO can be applied to efficiently design and select high quality compounds and describe the range of methods that have been employed in drug discovery, including; simple 'rules of thumb' such as Lipinski's rule; desirability functions; Pareto optimization; and probabilistic approaches that take into consideration the uncertainty in all drug discovery data due to predictive error and experimental variability. We will explore how these methods have been applied to predicted and experimental data to reduce attrition and improve the productivity of the drug discovery process.},

Animal studies might have overstated efficacy, or clinical trials might have understated efficacy; in either case we need to better understand the reasons for failure. Techniques borrowed from clinical trials have recently allowed the impact of publication and study-quality biases on published estimates of efficacy in animal experiments to be described. On the basis of these data, we propose minimum standards for the range and quality of pre-clinical animal data. We believe the adoption of these standards will lead to improved effectiveness and efficiency in the selection of drugs for clinical trials in stroke and in the design of those trials.},

  abstract    = {The consolidation of scientific knowledge proceeds through the interpretation and then distillation of data presented in research reports, first in review articles and then in textbooks and undergraduate courses, until truths become accepted as such both amongst "experts" and in the public understanding. Where data are collected but remain unpublished, they cannot contribute to this distillation of knowledge. If these unpublished data differ substantially from published work, conclusions may not reflect adequately the underlying biological effects being described. The existence and any impact of such "publication bias" in the laboratory sciences have not been described. Using the CAMARADES (Collaborative Approach to Meta-analysis and Review of Animal Data in Experimental Studies) database we identified 16 systematic reviews of interventions tested in animal studies of acute ischaemic stroke involving 525 unique publications. Only ten publications (2\%) reported no significant effects on infarct volume and only six (1.2\%) did not report at least one significant finding. Egger regression and trim-and-fill analysis suggested that publication bias was highly prevalent (present in the literature for 16 and ten interventions, respectively) in animal studies modelling stroke. Trim-and-fill analysis suggested that publication bias might account for around one-third of the efficacy reported in systematic reviews, with reported efficacy falling from 31.3\% to 23.8\% after adjustment for publication bias. We estimate that a further 214 experiments (in addition to the 1,359 identified through rigorous systematic review; non publication rate 14\%) have been conducted but not reported. It is probable that publication bias has an important impact in other animal disease models, and more broadly in the life sciences.},

Two controversies involving Fisher in the 1930s are discussed: one with Neyman concerning additivity and the other with Student concerning randomization. Their relevance today is considered, as is whether randomization inference in clinical trials is dead and whether modelling rules the day, whether minimization is an acceptable procedure and to what extent trialists confuse experiments with surveys. It will be maintained that a number of different possible purposes of clinical trials have been confused because in the case of the general linear model, under strong additivity, they can all be satisfied by a single analysis. More generally, however, this is not the case.},

Particularly, unfortunate is the widespread use of the so-called 'responder analysis', which may involve not only a loss of information through dichotomization, but also extravagant and unjustified causal inference regarding individual treatment effects at the patient level, and, increasingly, the use of the so-called number needed to treat scale of measurement. Other problems involve inefficient use of baseline measurements, the use of covariates measured after the start of treatment, the interpretation of titrations and composite response measures. Many of these bad practices are becoming enshrined in the regulatory guidance to the pharmaceutical industry.

  abstract  = {Research reports on de novo neurogenesis, particularly dopaminergic (DA) neurogenesis in the adult mammalian substantia nigra (SN), remain very controversial. For this reason, we used the nestin second intron enhancer-controlled LacZ reporter transgenic mouse model coupled with the 1-methyl-4-phyenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesion system to investigate whether there are neurogenesis and DA neurogenesis in the SN of the adult normal and Parkinson's disease (PD)-like mice. First, we demonstrated the presence of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), basal levels of neurogenesis, and DA neurogenesis in the normal adult mouse SN. Second, we showed that there is not only a significant increase in the number of NPCs but also a dramatic increase of neurogenesis from the NPCs in the SN and the midline region adjacent to the SN of the PD-like mice compared with that of normal controls. More importantly, we also demonstrated that there is an increase of DA neurogenesis in the SN of the MPTP-lesioned mice. Third, we showed that the increased DA neurogenesis in the MPTP-lesioned mice was derived from the NPCs and 5-bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells, suggesting that multiple stem cell lineages may contribute to the enhanced neurogenesis in the adult SN. Taken together, these results establish that there are basal levels, albeit low, and increased levels of de novo neurogenesis and DA neurogenesis in the SN of the adult normal and PD-like mice, respectively. The increased NPCs in the MPTP-lesioned mice further suggest that experimental approaches to promote de novo neurogenesis may provide an effective therapy for PD by functional replacement of degenerated DA neurons.},

There is considerable evidence in the literature to link hippocampal neurogenesis to the hippocampal-dependent memory function. However, simple correlations between neurogenesis and memory function, particularly in studies where neither the cause-effect relationship is established nor the other relevant variables are considered, can lead to erroneous conclusions. As reliable and selective neurogenesis ablation techniques are yet to be developed for rat and higher animal models, it is likely that correlative studies between the overall neurogenesis and the memory function will continue in different conditions in these animal models. Such correlations should be acceptable as long as the other variables are considered adequately. Furthermore, in correlative analyses of the learning and memory function with the newly born granule cells, one needs to consider the age of the newly born granule cells because the newly born granule cells will require at least a few weeks of time after their birth to participate in the learning and memory function in rodent models.},

  abstract    = {ABSTRACT: Animal models have contributed significantly to our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a result, over 300 interventions have been investigated and reported to mitigate pathological phenotypes or improve behavior in AD animal models or both. To date, however, very few of these findings have resulted in target validation in humans or successful translation to disease-modifying therapies. Challenges in translating preclinical studies to clinical trials include the inability of animal models to recapitulate the human disease, variations in breeding and colony maintenance, lack of standards in design, conduct and analysis of animal trials, and publication bias due to under-reporting of negative results in the scientific literature. The quality of animal model research on novel therapeutics can be improved by bringing the rigor of human clinical trials to animal studies. Research communities in several disease areas have developed recommendations for the conduct and reporting of preclinical studies in order to increase their validity, reproducibility, and predictive value. To address these issues in the AD community, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation partnered with Charles River Discovery Services (Morrisville, NC, USA) and Cerebricon Ltd. (Kuopio, Finland) to convene an expert advisory panel of academic, industry, and government scientists to make recommendations on best practices for animal studies testing investigational AD therapies. The panel produced recommendations regarding the measurement, analysis, and reporting of relevant AD targets, th choice of animal model, quality control measures for breeding and colony maintenance, and preclinical animal study design. Major considerations to incorporate into preclinical study design include a priori hypotheses, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics studies prior to proof-of-concept testing, biomarker measurements, sample size determination, and power analysis. The panel also recommended distinguishing between pilot 'exploratory' animal studies and more extensive 'therapeutic' studies to guide interpretation. Finally, the panel proposed infrastructure and resource development, such as the establishment of a public data repository in which both positive animal studies and negative ones could be reported. By promoting best practices, these recommendations can improve the methodological quality and predictive value of AD animal studies and make the translation to human clinical trials more efficient and reliable.},

A similar reduction did not affect learning when the same stimuli are not separated in time, a task that is hippocampal-independent. The reduction in neurogenesis did not induce death of mature hippocampal neurons or permanently alter neurophysiological properties of the CA1 region, such as long-term potentiation. Moreover, recovery of cell production was associated with the ability to acquire trace memories. These results indicate that newly generated neurons in the adult are not only affected by the formation of a hippocampal-dependent memory, but also participate in it.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (<= .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

In this report, we provide descriptions of hippocampal cytoarchitecture in the eastern rock sengi (Elephantulus myurus), of the distributions of hippocampal calretinin, calbindin, parvalbumin, and somatostatin, of principal neuron numbers, and of cell numbers related to proliferation and neuronal differentiation in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Sengi hippocampal cytoarchitecture is an amalgamation of characters that are found in CA1 of, e.g., guinea pig and rabbits and in CA3 and dentate gyrus of primates. Correspondence analysis of total cell numbers and quantitative relations between principal cell populations relate this sengi to macaque monkeys and domestic pigs, and distinguish the sengi from distinct patterns of relations found in humans, dogs, and murine rodents. Calretinin and calbindin are present in some cell populations that also express these proteins in other species, e.g., interneurons at the stratum oriens/alveus border or temporal hilar mossy cells, but neurons expressing these markers are often scarce or absent in other layers. The distributions of parvalbumin and somatostatin resemble those in other species. Normalized numbers of PCNA+ proliferating cells and doublecortin-positive (DCX+) differentiating cells of neuronal lineage fall within the overall ranges of murid rodents, but differed from three murid species captured in the same habitat in that fewer DCX+ cells relative to PCNA+ were observed. The large and well-differentiated sengi hippocampus is not accompanied by correspondingly sized cortical and subcortical limbic areas that are the main hippocampal sources of afferents and targets of efferents. This points to intrinsic hippocampal information processing as the selective advantage of the large sengi hippocampus.},

Transgenic mice expressing a human huntingtin transgene containing an expanded CAG repeat (R6/1 model) develop a neurodegenerative disorder closely resembling human HD. Previous work demonstrated that environmental enrichment delays the onset of motor symptoms in this mouse model. We confirmed that at 5 months of age, enrichment ameliorates motor symptoms (assessed using the rotarod test) and prevents loss of body weight induced by the HD transgene. We further examined molecular consequences of enrichment by determining changes in protein levels in the neostriatum, hippocampus, and anterior cortex using quantitative Western blot analysis. Non-enriched HD mice have severe reductions in BDNF in the hippocampus and striatum at 5 months, which are entirely rescued by enrichment. BDNF levels are unaltered by HD in the anterior cortex, suggesting that enrichment might prevent HD-induced impairment of anterograde transport of this neurotrophin to the striatum. NGF is unaffected by HD. Non-enriched HD mice also exhibit deficits in dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (32 kDa) in striatum and anterior cortex.

These results suggest that environmental enrichment benefits animals at early stages of the disease by rescuing protein deficits, possibly through rescuing transcription or protein transport problems.},

  abstract    = {Since its introduction into the biomedical literature, statistical significance testing (abbreviated as SST) caused much debate. The aim of this perspective article is to review frequent fallacies and misuses of SST in the biomedical field and to review a potential way out of the fallacies and misuses associated with SSTs. Two frequentist schools of statistical inference merged to form SST as it is practised nowadays: the Fisher and the Neyman-Pearson school. The P-value is both reported quantitatively and checked against the alpha-level to produce a qualitative dichotomous measure (significant/nonsignificant). However, a P-value mixes the estimated effect size with its estimated precision. Obviously, it is not possible to measure these two things with one single number. For the valid interpretation of SSTs, a variety of presumptions and requirements have to be met. We point here to four of them: study size, correct statistical model, correct causal model, and absence of bias and confounding. It has been stated that the P-value is perhaps the most misunderstood statistical concept in clinical research. As in the social sciences, the tyranny of SST is still highly prevalent in the biomedical literature even after decades of warnings against SST. The ubiquitous misuse and tyranny of SST threatens scientific discoveries and may even impede scientific progress. In the worst case, misuse of significance testing may even harm patients who eventually are incorrectly treated because of improper handling of P-values. For a proper interpretation of study results, both estimated effect size and estimated precision are necessary ingredients.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

The relationship between BDNF expression and dendritic spine number is particularly evident in the hippocampus, where environmental conditions that enhance hippocampal BDNF levels also promote local increases in dendritic spine density. However, the relationship between physiological variability in hippocampal BDNF expression and spine number has yet to be assessed. To determine whether natural variability in BDNF expression is associated with hippocampal dendritic spine number, correlations between BDNF protein levels and dendritic spine density among Golgi-impregnated neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA1 subfields were assessed in adult male C57Bl/6J mice. In the dentate gyrus, but not in the apical oblique dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, BDNF protein expression was significantly correlated with dendritic spine density. This observation suggests that there may be a subregionally specific relationship between hippocampal BDNF expression and the density of spines.},

Exercise was associated with increased dendritic spine density not only in granule neurons of the dentate gyrus, but also in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and in layer III pyramidal neurons of the entorhinal cortex. In the CA1 region, changes in dendritic spine density are accompanied by changes in dendritic arborization and alterations in the morphology of individual spines. These findings suggest that physical activity exerts pervasive effects on neuronal morphology in the hippocampus and one of its afferent populations. These structural changes may contribute to running-induced changes in cognitive function.},

A key feature of this paradigm is that it decouples error probabilities from measures of evidence. We describe the philosophy behind and the operating characteristics of this paradigm--based on new, alternatively-defined error probabilities. We then apply this approach to linkage studies of a genetic trait for: I. fully informative gametes, II. double backcross sibling pairs, and III. nuclear families. We consider complete and incomplete penetrance for the disease model, as well as using an incorrect penetrance. We calculate the error probabilities (exactly for situations I and II, via simulation for III), over a range of recombination fractions, sample sizes, and linkage criteria. We show how to choose linkage criteria and plan linkage studies, such that the probabilities of being misled by the data (i.e. concluding either that there is strong evidence favouring linkage when there is no linkage, or that there is strong evidence against linkage when there is linkage) are low, and the probability of observing strong evidence in favour of the truth is high. We lay the groundwork for applying this paradigm in genetic studies and for understanding its implications for multiple tests.},

  abstract    = {The 'multiple testing problem' currently bedevils the field of genetic epidemiology. Briefly stated, this problem arises with the performance of more than one statistical test and results in an increased probability of committing at least one Type I error. The accepted/conventional way of dealing with this problem is based on the classical Neyman-Pearson statistical paradigm and involves adjusting one's error probabilities. This adjustment is, however, problematic because in the process of doing that, one is also adjusting one's measure of evidence. Investigators have actually become wary of looking at their data, for fear of having to adjust the strength of the evidence they observed at a given locus on the genome every time they conduct an additional test. In a companion paper in this issue (Strug & Hodge I), we presented an alternative statistical paradigm, the 'evidential paradigm', to be used when planning and evaluating linkage studies. The evidential paradigm uses the lod score as the measure of evidence (as opposed to a p value), and provides new, alternatively defined error probabilities (alternative to Type I and Type II error rates). We showed how this paradigm separates or decouples the two concepts of error probabilities and strength of the evidence. In the current paper we apply the evidential paradigm to the multiple testing problem - specifically, multiple testing in the context of linkage analysis. We advocate using the lod score as the sole measure of the strength of evidence; we then derive the corresponding probabilities of being misled by the data under different multiple testing scenarios. We distinguish two situations: performing multiple tests of a single hypothesis, vs. performing a single test of multiple hypotheses. For the first situation the probability of being misled remains small regardless of the number of times one tests the single hypothesis, as we show. For the second situation, we provide a rigorous argument outlining how replication samples themselves (analyzed in conjunction with the original sample) constitute appropriate adjustments for conducting multiple hypothesis tests on a data set.},

  abstract    = {Investigators performing genetic association studies grapple with how to measure strength of association evidence, choose sample size, and adjust for multiple testing. We apply the evidential paradigm (EP) to genetic association studies, highlighting its strengths. The EP uses likelihood ratios (LRs), as opposed to P-values or Bayes' factors, to measure strength of association evidence. We derive EP methodology to estimate sample size, adjust for multiple testing, and provide informative graphics for drawing inferences, as illustrated with a Rolandic Epilepsy (RE) fine-mapping study. We focus on controlling the probability of observing weak evidence for or against association (W) rather than type I errors (M). For example, for LR> or =32 representing strong evidence, at one locus with n=200 cases, n=200 controls, W=0.134, whereas M=0.005. For n=300 cases and controls, W=0.039 and M=0.004. These calculations are based on detecting an OR=1.5. Despite the common misconception, one is not tied to this planning value for analysis; rather one calculates the likelihood at all possible values to assess evidence for association. We provide methodology to adjust for multiple tests across m loci, which adjusts M and W for m. We do so for (a) single-stage designs, (b) two-stage designs, and (c) simultaneously controlling family-wise error rate (FWER) and W.

  Abstract                 = {High-throughput screening is an essential process in drug discovery. The ability to identify true active compounds depends on the high quality of assays and proper analysis of data. The Z factor, presented by Zhang et al. in 1999, provides an easy and useful summary of assay quality and has been a widely accepted standard. However, as data analysis has undergone much improvement recently, the assessment of assay quality has not evolved in parallel. In this article, the authors study the implications of Z factor values under different conditions and link the Z factor with the power of discovering true active compounds. They discuss the different interpretations of Z factor depending on error distributions and advocate direct analysis of power as assay quality assessment. They also propose that in estimating assay quality parameters, adjustments in data analysis should be taken into account. Studying the power of identifying true "hits" gives a more direct interpretation of assay quality and may provide guidance in assay optimization on some occasions.},

  abstract    = {Depression and anxiety disorders have been linked to dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and structural changes within the hippocampus. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) can recapitulate these effects in a mouse model, and UCMS-induced changes, including downregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis, can be reversed by antidepressant (AD) treatment. We investigated causality between changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and the effects of both chronic stress and chronic ADs.Mice were treated with either a sham procedure or focal hippocampal irradiation to disrupt cell proliferation before being confronted with 5 weeks of UCMS. From the third week onward, we administered monoaminergic ADs (imipramine, fluoxetine), the corticotropin-releasing factor 1 (CRF(1)) antagonist SSR125543, or the vasopressin 1b (V(1b)) antagonist SSR149415 daily. The effects of UCMS regimen, AD treatments, and irradiation were assessed by physical measures (coat state, weight), behavioral testing (Splash test, Novelty-Suppressed feeding test, locomotor activity), and hippocampal BrdU labeling.Our results show that elimination of hippocampal neurogenesis has no effect on animals' sensitivity to UCMS in several behavioral assays, suggesting that reduced neurogenesis is not a cause of stress-related behavioral deficits. Second, we present evidence for both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms for the reversal of stress-induced behaviors by AD drugs. Specifically, loss of neurogenesis completely blocked the effects of monoaminergic ADs (imipramine, fluoxetine) but did not prevent most effects of the CRF(1) and the V(1b) antagonists.Hippocampal neurogenesis might thus be used by the monoaminergic ADs to counteract the effects of stress, whereas similar effects could be achieved by directly targeting the HPA axis and related neuropeptides.},

Despite the widespread occurrence of neural stem/progenitor cells, active adult neurogenesis has been established only in two restricted regions. We explored in this study a previously overlooked neurogenic region in the adult rat brain and detected the evidence of neuron production within the subcortical white matter. Dividing Pax6- and Olig2-positive neural progenitor cells continually gave rise to doublecortin-positive new neurons in this region. However, the vast majority of newborn neurons were lost within a week of their birth. Accumulated apoptotic cells indicated the ongoing cell death in this area. In addition to providing the evidence of newborn cell migration to the hippocampus, these results suggest that cell genesis, death, and migration persist in a restricted subregion of the adult white matter.},

Previous studies have shown that experimental increases in the levels of adrenal steroids suppress the proliferation of granule cell precursors during the first postnatal week, the time of maximal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. These findings raise the possibility that stressful experiences that elevate adrenal steroid levels may inhibit the production of granule neurons, and thus alter the development of the dentate gyrus. To test this possibility, we exposed naive rat pups to the odors of a known predator, adult male rats, and examined both plasma corticosterone levels and the number of 3H-thymidine labeled cells in the dentate gyrus. A single exposure of rat pups to adult male rat odor elevated corticosterone levels immediately and diminished the number of 3H-thymidine labeled cells in the granule cell layer by 24 h later. These results suggest that stressful experiences suppress the production of granule neurons in the developing dentate gyrus.},

The approach is based on the well known technique of generating a large number of samples in a Monte Carlo study, and estimating power as the percentage of cases in which an estimate of interest is significantly different from zero. Examples of power calculation for commonly used mediational models are provided. Power analyses for the single mediator, multiple mediators, three-path mediation, mediation with latent variables, moderated mediation, and mediation in longitudinal designs are described.

Chick retino-recipient tectal cells positive for Pax7 also co-expressed ephrin-A2, a molecule involved in the establishment and refinement of the retinotopic map. In vitro, PAX7 up-regulated ephrin-A2 when transfected into undifferentiated P19 cells; cells became negative for both Pax7 and ephrin-A2 protein following treatment with anti-sense oligonucleotides. These results suggest that in addition to being involved in the early establishment of tectal polarity, Pax7 plays a later role in retino-tectal map formation and refinement.},

Neural progenitor cells were prepared from either the Pax7-expressing dorsal (DM) or non-Pax7-expressing ventral mesencephalon (VM) of embryonic EGFP(+/+) rats. Cells were dissociated and grafted into the adult rat superior colliculus (SC) lesioned with quinolinic acid 3 days previously, a time shown to be associated with the up-regulation of Pax7. Grafts were then examined 4 weeks later. Our results suggest the origin of the graft tissue did not alter graft survival in the SC; however, dorsal grafts appear to have a higher incidence of neuronal survival, whereas ventral grafts have a higher incidence of astrocytic survivors.},

  abstract    = {Animal studies generate valuable hypotheses that lead to the conduct of preventive or therapeutic clinical trials. We assessed whether there is evidence for excess statistical significance in results of animal studies on neurological disorders, suggesting biases. We used data from meta-analyses of interventions deposited in Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data in Experimental Studies (CAMARADES). The number of observed studies with statistically significant results (O) was compared with the expected number (E), based on the statistical power of each study under different assumptions for the plausible effect size. We assessed 4,445 datasets synthesized in 160 meta-analyses on Alzheimer disease (n = 2), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (n = 34), focal ischemia (n = 16), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 61), Parkinson disease (n = 45), and spinal cord injury (n = 2). 112 meta-analyses (70\%) found nominally (p<=0.05) statistically significant summary fixed effects. Assuming the effect size in the most precise study to be a plausible effect, 919 out of 4,445 nominally significant results were expected versus 1,719 observed (p<10e-9). Excess significance was present across all neurological disorders, in all subgroups defined by methodological characteristics, and also according to alternative plausible effects. Asymmetry tests also showed evidence of small-study effects in 74 (46\%) meta-analyses. Significantly effective interventions with more than 500 animals, and no hints of bias were seen in eight (5\%) meta-analyses. Overall, there are too many animal studies with statistically significant results in the literature of neurological disorders. This observation suggests strong biases, with selective analysis and outcome reporting biases being plausible explanations, and provides novel evidence on how these biases might influence the whole research domain of neurological animal literature.},

  Abstract                 = {This article described three heuristics that are employed in making judgements under uncertainty: (i) representativeness, which is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B; (ii) availability of instances or scenarios, which is often employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the plausibility of a particular development; and (iii) adjustment from an anchor, which is usually employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available. These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.},

  abstract    = {Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BEC) constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which forms a dynamic interface between the blood and the central nervous system (CNS). This highly specialized interface restricts paracellular diffusion of fluids and solutes including chemicals, toxins and drugs from entering the brain. In this study we compared the transcriptome profiles of the human immortalized brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 and human primary BEC. We identified transcriptional differences in immune response genes which are directly related to the immortalization procedure of the hCMEC/D3 cells. Interestingly, astrocytic co-culturing reduced cell adhesion and migration molecules in both BECs, which possibly could be related to regulation of immune surveillance of the CNS controlled by astrocytic cells within the neurovascular unit. By matching the transcriptome data from these two cell lines with published transcriptional data from freshly isolated mouse BECs, we discovered striking differences that could explain some of the limitations of using cultured BECs to study BBB properties. Key protein classes such as tight junction proteins, transporters and cell surface receptors show differing expression profiles. For example, the claudin-5, occludin and JAM2 expression is dramatically reduced in the two human BEC lines, which likely explains their low transcellular electric resistance and paracellular leakiness. In addition, the human BEC lines express low levels of unique brain endothelial transporters such as Glut1 and Pgp. Cell surface receptors such as LRP1, RAGE and the insulin receptor that are involved in receptor-mediated transport are also expressed at very low levels. Taken together, these data illustrate that BECs lose their unique protein expression pattern outside of their native environment and display a more generic endothelial cell phenotype. A collection of key genes that seems to be highly regulated by the local surroundings of BEC within the neurovascular unit are presented and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this epidemiological survey (N = 1600) was to describe the factors which middle-aged urban people in Finland perceived as promoting or disturbing sleep. The response rate was 75\%. The results suggested that quality of sleep is determined by numerous factors; social and psychological factors, health status, external sleeping conditions, life style and living habits. Every third respondent felt that exercise had a positive impact on sleep. Second in importance were reading and listening to music. Furthermore, sauna, shower and bath, stability in life, psychological factors, positive experience in work, satisfactory sexual life and good and quiet sleeping environment were reported to have positive effects on sleep. Men considered work-related pressure and fatigue (20\%) as the most important factor disturbing falling asleep or quality of sleep. In women's ranking work problems appeared no sooner than in the third place. Women reported worries, interpersonal problems, and marital and family discord as the most disturbing factors to sleep (37\%). Coffee in the evening had a negative effect on falling asleep. Although a 'nightcap' was considered to improve relaxation on falling sleep, men ranked alcohol as the fourth disturbing factor. Other disturbing factors were stress, irregularities in everyday life because of social events, travelling or atypical catnaps. Eating and exercising too heavily or too late in the evening were found to disturb sleep. On the other hand, temporary lack of exercise seemed to impair the quality of sleep. As external factors disturbing sleep the subjects considered noise light, too high room temperature, tight clothing, unfamiliar sleeping environment and restless children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Bridging the gap between animal or in vitro models and human disease is essential in medical research. Researchers often suggest that a biological mechanism is relevant to human cancer from the statistical association of a gene expression marker (a signature) of this mechanism, that was discovered in an experimental system, with disease outcome in humans. We examined this argument for breast cancer. Surprisingly, we found that gene expression signatures-unrelated to cancer-of the effect of postprandial laughter, of mice social defeat and of skin fibroblast localization were all significantly associated with breast cancer outcome. We next compared 47 published breast cancer outcome signatures to signatures made of random genes. Twenty-eight of them (60\%) were not significantly better outcome predictors than random signatures of identical size and 11 (23\%) were worst predictors than the median random signature. More than 90\% of random signatures >100 genes were significant outcome predictors. We next derived a metagene, called meta-PCNA, by selecting the 1\% genes most positively correlated with proliferation marker PCNA in a compendium of normal tissues expression. Adjusting breast cancer expression data for meta-PCNA abrogated almost entirely the outcome association of published and random signatures. We also found that, in the absence of adjustment, the hazard ratio of outcome association of a signature strongly correlated with meta-PCNA (R(2) = 0.9). This relation also applied to single-gene expression markers. Moreover, >50\% of the breast cancer transcriptome was correlated with meta-PCNA. A corollary was that purging cell cycle genes out of a signature failed to rule out the confounding effect of proliferation. Hence, it is questionable to suggest that a mechanism is relevant to human breast cancer from the finding that a gene expression marker for this mechanism predicts human breast cancer outcome, because most markers do. The methods we present help to overcome this problem.},

  abstract    = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: In many randomized and non-randomized comparative trials, researchers measure a continuous endpoint repeatedly in order to decrease intra-patient variability and thus increase statistical power. There has been little guidance in the literature as to selecting the optimal number of repeated measures. METHODS: The degree to which adding a further measure increases statistical power can be derived from simple formulae. This "marginal benefit" can be used to inform the optimal number of repeat assessments. RESULTS: Although repeating assessments can have dramatic effects on power, marginal benefit of an additional measure rapidly decreases as the number of measures rises. There is little value in increasing the number of either baseline or post-treatment assessments beyond four, or seven where baseline assessments are taken. An exception is when correlations between measures are low, for instance, episodic conditions such as headache. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method offers a rational basis for determining the number of repeat measures in repeat measures designs.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Many randomized trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at baseline and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between baseline and post-treatment; percentage change between baseline and post-treatment and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between baseline and post-treatment scores. RESULTS: ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from baseline has acceptable power when correlation between baseline and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from baseline has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from baseline will also fail to protect from bias in the case of baseline imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage change from baseline should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores.},

Our review pulls together material that is currently scattered across many sources and emphasizes those techniques that are especially effective for typical ecological and environmental problems. We demonstrate how straightforward it can be to write efficient code and implement techniques such as profiling or parallel computing. We supply a newly developed R package (aprof) that helps to identify computational bottlenecks in R code and determine whether optimization can be effective. Our review is complemented by a practical set of examples and detailed Supporting Information material (S1-S3 Texts) that demonstrate large improvements in computational speed (ranging from 10.5 times to 14,000 times faster). By improving computational efficiency, biologists can feasibly solve more complex tasks, ask more ambitious questions, and include more sophisticated analyses in their research.},

  abstract    = {In the field of psychology, the practice of p value null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

  abstract    = {In a classic 1978 Memory & Cognition article, Geoff Loftus explained why noncrossover interactions are removable. These removable interactions are tied to the scale of measurement for the dependent variable and therefore do not allow unambiguous conclusions about latent psychological processes. In the present article, we present concrete examples of how this insight helps prevent experimental psychologists from drawing incorrect conclusions about the effects of forgetting and aging. In addition, we extend the Loftus classification scheme for interactions to include those on the cusp between removable and nonremovable. Finally, we use various methods (i.e., a study of citation histories, a questionnaire for psychology students and faculty members, an analysis of statistical textbooks, and a review of articles published in the 2008 issue of Psychology and Aging) to show that experimental psychologists have remained generally unaware of the concept of removable interactions. We conclude that there is more to interactions in a 2 × 2 design than meets the eye.},

In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology’s academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result—a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label “confirmatory,” and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled “exploratory.” We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception.},

Mixed effect modeling (MEM) provides a robust analytical approach for addressing problems associated with hierarchical data. This article compares the application of MEM to traditional ANOVA models within the context of a developmental study of prenatal ethanol exposure in mice. The results of the MEM analyses supported the ANOVA results in showing that a large proportion of the variability in both behavioral score and brain weight could be explained by ethanol. The MEM also identified that there were significant interactions between ethanol and litter size in relation to behavioral scores and brain weight. In addition, the longitudinal modeling approach using linear MEM allowed us to model for flexible weight gain over time, as well as to provide precise estimates of these effects, which would be difficult in repeated measures ANOVA.},

Molecular genetic studies in children and adolescents with OCD are of particular interest, since early onset of the disease has been observed to be associated with increased familiality. We replicate here for the first time in early-onset OCD patients, a previously reported association of OCD with the common gain-of-function LA allele at the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region known as 5-HTTLPR in a collection of parent-offspring trios. The present meta-analysis of this recently refined serotonin transporter gene variant revealed further support for the LA allele conferring increased genetic susceptibility to OCD. We conclude that the 5-HTTLPR is currently the single best supported risk variant for OCD, in regards of early-onset OCD, albeit of modest effect size and the possibility that the conferred risk might not be specific to OCD.},

Mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) lead to the most aggressive form of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), and are associated with accelerated plaque deposition. However, since the function of PS1 is pleiotropic, we reasoned that the FAD mutations may alter multiple PS1-mediated pathways, and the combination of which may account for the early onset nature of the disease phenotype. Using the PS1M146V knockin mice in which the M146V mutation was incorporated into the endogenous mouse PS1 gene, we report here that the FAD mutation results in impaired hippocampus-dependent associative learning, as measured by a contextual fear conditioning paradigm, at 3 months of age. This is correlated with reduced adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. However, short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity in both area CA1 and dentate gyrus are not affected. Our results suggest that impaired adult neurogenesis may contribute to the memory deficit associated with FAD.},

Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

  abstract    = {During the neonatal period, activity-dependent neural-circuit remodelling coincides with growth and refinement of the cerebral microvasculature. Whether neural activity also influences the patterning of the vascular bed is not known. Here we show in neonatal mice, that neither reduction of sensory input through whisker trimming nor moderately increased activity by environmental enrichment affects cortical microvascular development. Unexpectedly, chronic stimulation by repetitive sounds, whisker deflection or motor activity led to a near arrest of angiogenesis in barrel, auditory and motor cortices, respectively. Chemically induced seizures also caused robust reductions in microvascular density. However, altering neural activity in adult mice did not affect the vasculature. Histological analysis and time-lapse in vivo two-photon microscopy revealed that hyperactivity did not lead to cell death or pruning of existing vessels but rather to reduced endothelial proliferation and vessel sprouting. This anti-angiogenic effect was prevented by administration of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME and in mice with neuronal and inducible NOS deficiency, suggesting that excessive nitric oxide released from hyperactive interneurons and glia inhibited vessel growth. Vascular deficits persisted long after cessation of hyperstimulation, providing evidence for a critical period after which proper microvascular patterning cannot be re-established. Reduced microvascular density diminished the ability of the brain to compensate for hypoxic challenges, leading to dendritic spine loss in regions distant from capillaries. Therefore, excessive sensorimotor stimulation and repetitive neural activation during early childhood may cause lifelong deficits in microvascular reserve, which could have important consequences for brain development, function and pathology.},

  abstract    = {The widespread reluctance to share published research data is often hypothesized to be due to the authors' fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically.We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance.Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.},

METHODS: Nine MTBI patients (27.8 months post-injury; SD=15.5 months) and nine control subjects underwent polysomnographic testing and completed self-report questionnaires on sleep quality. Power spectral (FFT) analysis of the sleep onset period was conducted, with both the power and variability in power being quantified. RESULTS: Individuals with MTBI exhibited long-term sleep difficulties, along with various cognitive and affective abnormalities. The MTBI group had 4\% less efficient sleep (p=0.019), shorter REM onset latencies (p=0.011), and longer sleep onset latencies, although the latter were highly variable in the MTBI group (F-test: p=0.012). FFT analysis revealed greater intra-subject variability in the MTBI group in sigma, theta, and delta power during the sleep onset period. CONCLUSIONS: MTBI patients with persistent sleep complaints differ significantly from controls on a number of electrophysiological outcomes, but could not be easily classified into existing insomnia subtypes. SIGNIFICANCE: Sleep disturbances can persist well after the injury in a subset of patients with MTBI.},

  abstract  = {We have previously performed detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments in a community-based cohort of patients with newly diagnosed parkinsonism, and through analysis of a subcohort with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), we have demonstrated that cognitive dysfunction occurs even at the time of PD diagnosis and is heterogeneous. Longitudinal follow-up of the cohort has now been performed to examine the evolution of cognitive dysfunction within the early years of the disease. One hundred and eighty (79\%) eligible patients from the original cohort with parkinsonism were available for re-assessment at between 3 and 5 years from their initial baseline assessments. PD diagnoses were re-validated with repeated application of the UKPDS Brain Bank criteria in order to maximize sensitivity and specificity, following which a diagnosis of idiopathic PD was confirmed in 126 patients. Thirteen out of 126 (10\%) had developed dementia at a mean (SD) of 3.5 (0.7) years from diagnosis, corresponding to an annual dementia incidence of 30.0 (16.4-52.9) per 1000 person-years. A further 57\% of PD patients showed evidence of cognitive impairment, with frontostriatal deficits being most common amongst the non-demented group. However, the most important clinical predictors of global cognitive decline following correction for age were neuropsychological tasks with a more posterior cortical basis, including semantic fluency and ability to copy an intersecting pentagons figure, as well as a non-tremor dominant motor phenotype at the baseline assessment. This work clarifies the profile of cognitive dysfunction in early PD and demonstrates that the dementing process in this illness is heralded by both postural and gait dysfunction and cognitive deficits with a posterior cortical basis, reflecting probable non-dopaminergic cortical Lewy body pathology. Furthermore, given that these predictors of dementia are readily measurable within just a few minutes in a clinical setting, our work may ultimately have practical implications in terms of guiding prognosis in individual patients.},

Olfaction is synthetic, as mammals have only limited ability to identify elements within even simple odor mixtures. Furthermore, olfaction is experience-bound, as exposure alone can significantly affect the extent to which stimuli can be discriminated. We propose that early analytical processing of odors is inaccessible at the behavioral level and that all odors are initially encoded as 'objects' in the piriform cortex. Moreover, we suggest that odor perception is wholly dependent on the integrity of this memory system and that its loss severely impairs normal perception.},

In these disorders, alpha-synuclein accumulates within glial or neuronal cells in the brain including regions of adult neurogenesis. We hypothesized a pathophysiological role for alpha-synuclein in newly generated cells of the adult brain and in this study examined regions of neurogenesis in adult mice overexpressing human wild-type alpha-synuclein under the control of the platelet-derived growth factor promoter. The number of proliferating cells and the fate of newly generated cells were analyzed in the olfactory bulb system and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. There were no effects on proliferation detectable; however, significantly less neurogenesis and fewer neurons were observed in the olfactory bulb as well as in the hippocampus of adult human alpha-synuclein mice compared to control littermates. This effect was almost exclusively due to diminished survival of neuronal precursors in the target regions of neurogenesis. Our data imply that the finely tuned equilibrium of neuronal cell birth and death in neurogenic regions may be altered in human alpha-synuclein-overexpressing mice. We hypothesize that reduced adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb may contribute to olfactory deficits in neurodegenerative disorders associated with alpha-synuclein inclusions.},

  Abstract                 = {It is known that statistically significant (positive) results are more likely to be published than non-significant (negative) results. However, it has been unclear whether any increasing prevalence of positive results is stronger in the "softer" disciplines (social sciences) than in the "harder" disciplines (physical sciences), and whether the prevalence of negative results is decreasing over time. Using Scopus, we searched the abstracts of papers published between 1990 and 2013, and measured longitudinal trends of multiple expressions of positive versus negative results, including p-values between 0.041 and 0.049 versus p-values between 0.051 and 0.059, textual reporting of "significant difference" versus "no significant difference," and the reporting of p < 0.05 versus p > 0.05. We found no support for a "hierarchy of sciences" with physical sciences at the top and social sciences at the bottom. However, we found large differences in reporting practices between disciplines, with p-values between 0.041 and 0.049 over 1990-2013 being 65.7 times more prevalent in the biological sciences than in the physical sciences. The p-values near the significance threshold of 0.05 on either side have both increased but with those p-values between 0.041 and 0.049 having increased to a greater extent (2013-to-1990 ratio of the percentage of papers = 10.3) than those between 0.051 and 0.059 (ratio = 3.6). Contradictorily, p < 0.05 has increased more slowly than p > 0.05 (ratios = 1.4 and 4.8, respectively), while the use of "significant difference" has shown only a modest increase compared to "no significant difference" (ratios = 1.5 and 1.1, respectively). We also compared reporting of significance in the United States, Asia, and Europe and found that the results are too inconsistent to draw conclusions on cross-cultural differences in significance reporting. We argue that the observed longitudinal trends are caused by negative factors, such as an increase of questionable research practices, but also by positive factors, such as an increase of quantitative research and structured reporting.},

  Abstract                 = {The DBA/2J mouse is a model of pigmentary glaucoma in humans as it shows age-related increases in intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal ganglion cell death and visual impairment. Previously, we showed that visual ability declines from 9 to 12 months of age and visual impairment is correlated with poor learning and memory performance in visuo-spatial tasks but not in tasks that do not depend on visual cues. To test the "sensory impairment" hypothesis of aging, which postulates that sensory impaired individuals are disadvantaged in their performance on psychometric tests as a direct result of difficulties in sensory perception, we treated DBA/2J mice with a conventional glaucoma medication used in humans (Timoptic-XE, 0.00, 0.25, or 0.50\%) daily from 9 weeks to 12 months of age to determine whether prevention of vision loss prevented the decline in visuo-spatial learning and memory performance. At all ages tested (3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age), mice treated with Timoptic-XE (0.25 and 0.50\%) maintained a high level of performance, while 12 month old control mice (0.00\%) exhibited impaired performance in visually-dependent, but not non-visual tasks. These results demonstrate that when sensory function is preserved, cognitive performance is normalized. Thus, as in many aging humans, DBA/2J mice show age-related decrements in performance on visually presented cognitive tests, not because of cognitive impairment but as a direct consequence of poor visual ability. Our results demonstrate that age-related impairment in performance in visuo-spatial tasks in DBA/2J mice can be prevented by the preservation of visual ability.},

  abstract  = {Neurons are added throughout life to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the mammalian brain. Progenitors residing in the dentate gyrus progress through three distinct stages of adult neurogenesis: proliferation, survival and differentiation. One of the most potent factors which regulates adult neurogenesis is adrenal-derived glucocorticoids. Raised levels of glucocorticoids suppress progenitor division, while removal of glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy stimulates proliferation of these cells in the dentate gyrus. We have recently reported that both pre- and post-mitotic corticoid environments powerfully regulate survival of progenitor cells in a time-dependent manner. However, it is unknown if glucocorticoids alter the process of neuronal differentiation, since not all of the newly-formed cells acquire a neuronal fate during development. Here we employ triple immuno-fluorescence staining techniques to phenotype surviving progenitor cells 28 days after labeling. Results show that high levels of corticosterone (the major glucocorticoid in rodents) either before or after progenitor labeling discouraged the acquisition of neuronal fate. Similar to its effect on survival, post-mitotic corticosterone also regulates neuronal differentiation in a time-dependent fashion, but this action is most prominent from around 19-27 days after the cells were born. In contrast, a corticoid-free environment either before or after progenitor proliferation did not affect neuronal differentiation. Combining these data with previous survival data obtained from the same animals allowed us to estimate the total number of neurons formed resulting from different corticoid treatments. Raised corticosterone significantly reduced neuronal production while adrenalectomy resulted in significantly higher number of neurons in the adult male rat hippocampus.},

Previous reports regarding the roles of these receptors in regulating cell proliferation came to contrasting conclusions. Here we use both agonists and antagonists to these receptors in adult male rats to investigate and clarify their roles. Blockade of MR with spironolactone in adrenalectomised male rats implanted with a corticosterone pellet to reproduce basal levels enhanced proliferation, whereas treatment with the GR antagonist mifepristone had no effect. However, mifepristone reversed the suppressive effect of additional corticosterone in intact rats. Both aldosterone and RU362, agonists of MR and GR, respectively, reduced proliferation in adrenalectomised rats, and combined treatment with both agonists had an additional suppressive action. These results clearly show that occupancies of both receptors act in the same direction on progenitor proliferation. The existence of two receptors with different affinities for corticoids may ensure that proliferation of progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus is regulated across the range of adrenal corticoid activity, including both basal and stressful contexts. Although a small proportion of newly formed cells may express GR and MR, corticosterone probably regulates proliferation indirectly through other local cells.},

  abstract  = {New neurons continue to be generated in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Corticosterone (CORT), a steroid secreted by the adrenal glands, had been shown to regulate progenitor proliferation. High levels of CORT suppress proliferation while low levels of the steroid stimulate it. Here we present an investigation into the regulation of survival by corticoids, with emphasis on the differential effects of the pre-mitotic and post-mitotic corticoid environments. Post-mitotic adrenalectomy increased subsequent survival of progenitors at 28 days, while additional CORT administered during the post-mitotic period decreased survival. In contrast, a corticoid-free environment prior to progenitor division resulted in a reduced survival rate of new cells and, similarly, high levels of CORT before proliferation reduced subsequent survival. In addition, phased treatment with CORT during a 27-day post-mitotic interval showed that newly formed cells lose their sensitivity to administered CORT after about 18 days. These results are the first to show that the corticoid environment both before and after cell division regulates survival.},

However, the reproducibility of data generated at multiple laboratory sites remains a matter of concern, especially for scientists who are attempting to combine and analyze data from public repositories. We have carried out a study in which a common set of RNA samples was assayed five times in four different laboratories using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. We observed dramatic differences in the results across laboratories and identified batch effects in array processing as one of the primary causes for these differences. When batch processing of samples is confounded with experimental factors of interest it is not possible to separate their effects, and lists of differentially expressed genes may include many artifacts. This study demonstrates the substantial impact of sample processing on microarray analysis results and underscores the need for randomization in the laboratory as a means to avoid confounding of biological factors with procedural effects.},

The adult SVZ contains neuroblasts that migrate in the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulbs. We have examined the distribution and phenotype of Dcx-positive cells in the adult mouse SVZ and surrounding regions. Chains of Dcx-positive cells in the SVZ were distributed in a tight dorsal population contiguous with the RMS, with a separate ventral population comprised of discontinuous chains. Unexpectedly, Dcx-positive cells were also found outside of the SVZ: dorsally in the corpus callosum, and ventrally in the nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum, ventrolateral septum, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Dcx-positive cells outside the SVZ had the morphology of migrating cells, occurred as individual cells or in chain-like clusters, and were more numerous anteriorly. Of the Dcx-positive cells found outside of the SVZ, 47\% expressed the immature neuronal protein class III beta-tubulin, 8\% expressed NeuN, a marker of mature neurons. Dcx-positive cells did not express molecules found in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or microglia. Structural and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that cells with the ultrastructural features of neuroblasts in the SVZ were Dcx+, and that clusters of neuroblasts emanated ventrally from the SVZ into the parenchyma. Our results suggest that the distribution of cells comprising the walls of the lateral ventricle are more heterogeneous than was thought previously, that SVZ cells may migrate dorsally and ventrally away from the SVZ, and that some emigrated cells express a neuronal phenotype.},

The present study provides evidence that hydrated PSA influences a sufficiently large volume at the cell surface to exert broad steric effects, and that the removal of PSA in fact causes a detectable change in intercellular space. Using F11 neuron/neuroblastoma hybrid cells as a model system, the measured density and size of PSA suggests that a substantial fraction of the space between two apposed cell surface membranes could be sterically influenced by the presence of PSA. Specific enzymatic removal of PSA, which is similar in magnitude to changes that occur in many tissues during normal development, caused about a 25\% decrease in the distance between two apposed cells. By contrast, removal of both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate from the cells had no effect on this parameter. It is proposed that such changes in membrane-membrane distance could serve to alter selectively the efficiency of encounter between complementary receptors on apposing cells, and explain at least in part the broad biological influences of PSA.},

  Abstract                 = {The Affymetrix GeneChip is a widely used gene expression profiling platform. Since the chips were originally designed, the genome databases and gene definitions have been considerably updated. Thus, more accurate interpretation of microarray data requires parallel updating of the specificity of GeneChip probes. We propose a new probe remapping protocol, using the zebrafish GeneChips as an example, by removing nonspecific probes, and grouping the probes into transcript level probe sets using an integrated zebrafish genome annotation. This genome annotation is based on combining transcript information from multiple databases. This new remapping protocol, especially the new genome annotation, is shown here to be an important factor in improving the interpretation of gene expression microarray data.Transcript data from the RefSeq, GenBank and Ensembl databases were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser, and integrated to generate a combined zebrafish genome annotation. Affymetrix probes were filtered and remapped according to the new annotation. The influence of transcript collection and gene definition methods was tested using two microarray data sets. Compared to remapping using a single database, this new remapping protocol results in up to 20\% more probes being retained in the remapping, leading to approximately 1,000 more genes being detected. The differentially expressed gene lists are consequently increased by up to 30\%. We are also able to detect up to three times more alternative splicing events. A small number of the bioinformatics predictions were confirmed using real-time PCR validation.By combining gene definitions from multiple databases, it is possible to greatly increase the numbers of genes and splice variants that can be detected in microarray gene expression experiments.},

Subsequent differentiation of labeled cells was followed; many transduced cells became microglia, but no differentiation into tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons was detected at 4 weeks after injection, in both intact rodents and those treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Second, polysialic acid (PSA)-like immunoreactivity, indicative of newly differentiated neurons, was detected in the substantia nigra of rodent, primate, and human midbrains. A large number of PSA-positive cells were detected in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of some patients with PD. In rats and a macaque monkey, the dopamine-depleted hemispheres showed more PSA staining than the intact side. A small number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells were PSA-positive.

This article advances this debate by asking the broader questions that we, as scientists, should be asking: How do scientists make decisions in the course of doing research, and what is the impact of these decisions on scientific conclusions? We asked practicing scientists to collect data in a simulated research environment, and our findings show that some scientists use data collection heuristics that deviate from prescribed methodology. Monte Carlo simulations show that data collection heuristics based on p values lead to biases in estimated effect sizes and Bayes factors and to increases in both false-positive and false-negative rates, depending on the specific heuristic. We also show that using Bayesian data collection methods does not eliminate these biases. Thus, our study highlights the little appreciated fact that the process of doing science is a behavioral endeavor that can bias statistical description and inference in a manner that transcends adherence to any particular statistical framework.},

  Abstract                 = {The wide use of Affymetrix microarray in broadened fields of biological research has made the probeset annotation an important issue. Standard Affymetrix probeset annotation is at gene level, i.e. a probeset is precisely linked to a gene, and probeset intensity is interpreted as gene expression. The increased knowledge that one gene may have multiple transcript variants clearly brings up the necessity of updating this gene-level annotation to a refined transcript-level.Through performing rigorous alignments of the Affymetrix probe sequences against a comprehensive pool of currently available transcript sequences, and further linking the probesets to the International Protein Index, we generated transcript-level or protein-level annotation tables for two popular Affymetrix expression arrays, Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array and Human Genome U133A Array. Application of our new annotations in re-examining existing expression data sets shows increased expression consistency among synonymous probesets and strengthened expression correlation between interacting proteins.By refining the standard Affymetrix annotation of microarray probesets from the gene level to the transcript level and protein level, one can achieve a more reliable interpretation of their experimental data, which may lead to discovery of more profound regulatory mechanism.},

First, it allows researchers to incorporate prior information into the mediation analysis, thus potentially improving the efficiency of estimates. Second, under the Bayesian mediation analysis, inference is straightforward and exact, which makes it appealing for studies with small samples. Third, the Bayesian approach is conceptually simpler for multilevel mediation analysis. Simulation studies and analysis of 2 data sets are used to illustrate the proposed methods.

The ability to identify hits from a particular HTS assay depends largely on the suitability or quality of the assay used in the screening. The criteria or parameters for evaluating the ³suitability² of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called ³Z-factor,² is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA interference (RNAi) high-throughput screening (HTS) enables massive parallel gene silencing and is increasingly being used to reveal novel connections between genes and disease-relevant phenotypes. The application of genome-scale RNAi relies on the development of high-quality RNAi HTS assays. To obtain high-quality HTS assays, there is a strong need for an easily interpretable and theoretically based quality control (QC) metric. Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), signal-to-background ratio (S/B), and Z-factor have been adopted as QC metrics in HTS assays. In this paper, I proposed a pair of new parameters, strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) and coefficient of variability in difference (CVD), as QC metrics in RNAi HTS assays. Compared to S/B and S/N, SSMD and CVD capture the variabilities in both compared populations. Compared to Z-factor, SSMD and CVD have a clear probability interpretation and a solid statistical basis. Accordingly, the cutoff criteria of using SSMD or CVD as a QC metric in HTS assays are fully theoretically based. In addition, I discuss the relationship between the SSMD-based criterion and the popular Z-factor-based criterion and elucidate why p-value from t-test of testing mean difference fails to serve as a QC metric.},

The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was administered before session 1 and after session 2, and results indicated that Sensory, Affective, and Present Pain Intensity subscales showed no group difference for pain; however, pain decreased from Day 2 to Day 3 for all three groups. For the evaluative component of pain, those in the music group had significantly (F[2,93] = 4.74, p < .05) lower scores on postoperative Day 2 than the rest period control group. Effects of the intervention on sleep as measured by the Richard Sleep Questionnaire indicated that the video group had significantly (F[2, 92] = 3.18, p < .05) better sleep scores than the control group on the third morning. These findings lend some support for selected music interventions.},

Furthermore, two-stage sampling, the practice of sampling only a subset of littermates from dams, can lower reliability, and therefore power, to unacceptable levels. In addition, the greater sensitivity offered by within-litter analyses over between-litter analyses is demonstrated. Statistical and experimental solutions are suggested and referenced. Surveys of recent developmental studies showed that the great majority do not attend to these issues, thereby casting doubt on the validity of their positive and negative findings.

The mutant protein is presumed to acquire a toxic gain of function that is detrimental to striatal neurons in the brain. However, loss of a beneficial activity of wild-type huntingtin may also cause the death of striatal neurons. Here we demonstrate that wild-type huntingtin up-regulates transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a pro-survival factor produced by cortical neurons that is necessary for survival of striatal neurons in the brain. We show that this beneficial activity of huntingtin is lost when the protein becomes mutated, resulting in decreased production of cortical BDNF. This leads to insufficient neurotrophic support for striatal neurons, which then die. Restoring wild-type huntingtin activity and increasing BDNF production may be therapeutic approaches for treating HD.},

  abstract  = {Huntingtin is a protein of 348 kDa that is mutated in Huntington's disease (HD), a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder. Previous data have led us to propose that aspects of the disease arise from both a loss of the neuroprotective function of the wild-type protein, and a toxic activity gained by the mutant protein. In particular, we have shown that wild-type huntingtin stimulates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a pro-survival factor for the striatal neurons that die in the pathology. Wild-type huntingtin controls BDNF gene transcription in cerebral cortex, which is then delivered to its striatal targets. In the disease state, supply of cortical BDNF to the striatum is strongly reduced, possibly leading to striatal vulnerability. Here we show that a reduction in cortical BDNF messenger level correlates with the progression of the disease in a mouse model of HD. In particular, we show that the progressive loss of mRNAs transcribed from BDNF exon II, III and IV follows a different pattern that may reflect different upstream mechanisms impaired by mutation in huntingtin. On this basis, we also discuss the possibility that delivery of BDNF may represent an useful strategy for Huntington's disease treatment.},

We assessed the internal consistency and the intercorrelations for the four domains and examined changes in ratings over time. We also performed an interrater reliability study of the motor assessment. We found there was a high degree of internal consistency within each of the domains of the UHDRS and that there were significant intercorrelations between the domains of the UHDRS, with the exception of the total behavioral score. There was an excellent degree of interrater reliability for the motor scores. Our limited longitudinal database indicates that the UHDRS may be useful for tracking changes in the clinical features of HD over time. The UHDRS assesses relevant clinical features of HD and appears to be appropriate for repeated administration during clinical studies.},

  abstract = {The marginal likelihood plays an important role in many areas of Bayesian statistics such as parameter estimation, model comparison, and model averaging. In most applications, however, the marginal likelihood is not analytically tractable and must be approximated using numerical methods. Here we provide a tutorial on bridge sampling (Bennett, 1976; Meng & Wong, 1996), a reliable and relatively straightforward sampling method that allows researchers to obtain the marginal likelihood for models of varying complexity. First, we introduce bridge sampling and three related sampling methods using the beta-binomial model as a running example. We then apply bridge sampling to estimate the marginal likelihood for the Expectancy Valence (EV) model—a popular model for reinforcement learning. Our results indicate that bridge sampling provides accurate estimates for both a single participant and a hierarchical version of the EV model. We conclude that bridge sampling is an attractive method for mathematical psychologists who typically aim to approximate the marginal likelihood for a limited set of possibly high-dimensional models.},

Conceived as a regression problem, the method is applicable to non-equidistant data, a major advantage. Another dividend is the feasibility of deriving confidence intervals for parameters of rhythmic components of known periods, readily drawn from the least squares procedure, stressing the importance of prior (external) information. Originally developed for the analysis of short and sparse data series, the extended cosinor has been further developed for the analysis of long time series, focusing both on rhythm detection and parameter estimation. Attention is given to the assumptions underlying the use of the cosinor and ways to determine whether they are satisfied. In particular, ways of dealing with non-stationary data are presented. Examples illustrate the use of the different cosinor-based methods, extending their application from the study of circadian rhythms to the mapping of broad time structures (chronomes).},

How does nonlinear regression differ from polynomial regression and cubic spline? How do nonlinear regression programs work? What choices must an investigator make before performing nonlinear regression? What do the final results mean? How can two sets of data or two fits to one set of data be compared? What problems can cause the results to be wrong? This review is designed to demystify nonlinear regression so that both its power and its limitations will be appreciated.},

  abstract = {Scientists are often steered by common convention, funding agencies, and journal guidelines into a hypothesis-driven experimental framework, despite Isaac Newton's dictum that hypotheses have no place in experimental science. Some may think that Newton's cautionary note, which was in keeping with an experimental approach espoused by Francis Bacon, is inapplicable to current experimental method since, in accord with the philosopher Karl Popper, modern-day hypotheses are framed to serve as instruments of falsification, as opposed to verification. But Popper's "critical rationalist" framework too is problematic. It has been accused of being: inconsistent on philosophical grounds; unworkable for modern "large science," such as systems biology; inconsistent with the actual goals of experimental science, which is verification and not falsification; and harmful to the process of discovery as a practical matter. A criticism of the hypothesis as a framework for experimentation is offered. Presented is an alternative framework-the query/model approach-which many scientists may discover is the framework they are actually using, despite being required to give lip service to the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of “significance” should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their “behavior” in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.},

  title       = {Language Models are Few-Shot Learners},
  year        = {2020},
  abstract    = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justifed theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.},

It regularises the weights by minimising a compression cost, known as the variational free energy or the expected lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs – extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract        = {Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses . The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset . Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.},

  abstract        = {Gene expression data from microarrays are being applied to predict preclinical and clinical endpoints, but the reliability of these predictions has not been established. In the MAQC-II project, 36 independent teams analyzed six microarray data sets to generate predictive models for classifying a sample with respect to one of 13 endpoints indicative of lung or liver toxicity in rodents, or of breast cancer, multiple myeloma or neuroblastoma in humans. In total, >30,000 models were built using many combinations of analytical methods. The teams generated predictive models without knowing the biological meaning of some of the endpoints and, to mimic clinical reality, tested the models on data that had not been used for training. We found that model performance depended largely on the endpoint and team proficiency and that different approaches generated models of similar performance. The conclusions and recommendations from MAQC-II should be useful for regulatory agencies, study committees and independent investigators that evaluate methods for global gene expression analysis.},

This architecture, in conjunction with a maximum a posteriori estimation scheme, is thus not calibrated nor robust. Approximate Bayesian inference has been empirically demonstrated to improve predictive uncertainty in neural networks, although the theoretical analysis of such Bayesian approximations is limited. We theoretically analyze approximate Gaussian distributions on the weights of ReLU networks and show that they fix the overconfidence problem. Furthermore, we show that even a simplistic, thus cheap, Bayesian approximation, also fixes these issues. This indicates that a sufficient condition for a calibrated uncertainty on a ReLU network is “to be a bit Bayesian”. These theoretical results validate the usage of last-layer Bayesian approximation and motivate a range of a fidelity-cost trade-off. We further validate these findings empirically via various standard experiments using common deep ReLU networks and Laplace approximations.},

The Bayesian framework provides a principled approach to this, however applying it to NNs is challenging due to large numbers of parameters and data. Ensembling NNs provides an easily implementable, scalable method for uncertainty quantification, however, it has been criticised for not being Bayesian. This work proposes one modification to the usual process that we argue does result in approximate Bayesian inference; regularising parameters about values drawn from a distribution which can be set equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of the procedure in a simplified setting suggests the recovered posterior is centred correctly but tends to have an underestimated marginal variance, and overestimated correlation. However, two conditions can lead to exact recovery. We argue that these conditions are partially present in NNs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate it has an advantage over standard ensembling, and is competitive with variational methods.},

We present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios. The method, which empirically performs better than existing methods for stabilizing importance sampling estimates, includes stabilized effective sample size estimates, Monte Carlo error estimates and convergence diagnostics.},

But modern algorithms for approximate Bayesian posterior inference often sacrifice accurate posterior uncertainty estimation in the pursuit of scalability. This work shows that previous Bayesian coreset construction algorithms—which build a small, weighted subset of the data that approximates the full dataset—are no exception. We demonstrate that these algorithms scale the coreset log-likelihood suboptimally, resulting in underestimated posterior uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we develop greedy iterative geodesic ascent (GIGA), a novel algorithm for Bayesian coreset construction that scales the coreset log-likelihood optimally. GIGA provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size, and maintains the fast running time of its predecessors. The paper concludes with validation of GIGA on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it reduces posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude compared with previous coreset constructions.},

  abstract      = {The use of Bayesian methods in large-scale data settings is attractive because of the rich hierarchical models, uncertainty quantification, and prior specification they provide. Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.},

We further demonstrate that this finding allows us to make meaningful estimates of the model uncertainty using conventional architectures, without modifications to the network or the training procedure. Our approach is thoroughly validated by measuring the quality of uncertainty in a series of empirical experiments on different tasks. It outperforms baselines with strong statistical significance, and displays competitive performance with recent Bayesian approaches.},

  abstract      = {Various methodological options exist on evaluating differences in both subgroups and the overall population. Most desirable is the simultaneous study of multiple endpoints in several populations. We investigate a newer method using multiple marginal models (mmm) which allows flexible handling of multiple endpoints, including continuous, binary or time-to-event data. This paper explores the performance of mmm in contrast to the standard Bonferroni approach via simulation. Mainly these methods are compared on the basis of their familywise error rate and power under different scenarios, varying in sample size and standard deviation. Additionally, it is shown that the method can deal with overlapping subgroup definitions and different combinations of endpoints may be assumed. The reanalysis of a clinical example shows a practical application.},

  abstract        = {Simultaneous inference in longitudinal, repeated-measures, and multi-endpoint designs can be onerous, especially when trying to find a reasonable joint model from which the interesting effects and covariances are estimated. A novel statistical approach known as multiple marginal models greatly simplifies the modelling process: the core idea is to "marginalise" the problem and fit multiple small models to different portions of the data, and then estimate the overall covariance matrix in a subsequent, separate step. Using these estimates guarantees strong control of the family-wise error rate, however only asymptotically. In this paper, we show how to make the approach also applicable to small-sample data problems. Specifically, we discuss the computation of adjusted P values and simultaneous confidence bounds for comparisons of randomised treatment groups as well as for levels of a nonrandomised factor such as multiple endpoints, repeated measures, or a series of points in time or space. We illustrate the practical use of the method with a data example.},

  abstract        = {Genetics and neuroscience are two areas of science that pose particular methodological problems because they involve detecting weak signals (i.e., small effects) in noisy data. In recent years, increasing numbers of studies have attempted to bridge these disciplines by looking for genetic factors associated with individual differences in behavior, cognition, and brain structure or function. However, different methodological approaches to guarding against false positives have evolved in the two disciplines. To explore methodological issues affecting neurogenetic studies, we conducted an in-depth analysis of 30 consecutive articles in 12 top neuroscience journals that reported on genetic associations in nonclinical human samples. It was often difficult to estimate effect sizes in neuroimaging paradigms. Where effect sizes could be calculated, the studies reporting the largest effect sizes tended to have two features: (i) they had the smallest samples and were generally underpowered to detect genetic effects, and (ii) they did not fully correct for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, only a minority of studies used statistical methods for multiple comparisons that took into account correlations between phenotypes or genotypes, and only nine studies included a replication sample or explicitly set out to replicate a prior finding. Finally, presentation of methodological information was not standardized and was often distributed across Methods sections and Supplementary Material, making it challenging to assemble basic information from many studies. Space limits imposed by journals could mean that highly complex statistical methods were described in only a superficial fashion. In summary, methods that have become standard in the genetics literature-stringent statistical standards, use of large samples, and replication of findings-are not always adopted when behavioral, cognitive, or neuroimaging phenotypes are used, leading to an increased risk of false-positive findings. Studies need to correct not just for the number of phenotypes collected but also for the number of genotypes examined, genetic models tested, and subsamples investigated. The field would benefit from more widespread use of methods that take into account correlations between the factors corrected for, such as spectral decomposition, or permutation approaches. Replication should become standard practice; this, together with the need for larger sample sizes, will entail greater emphasis on collaboration between research groups. We conclude with some specific suggestions for standardized reporting in this area.},

  abstract        = {Subgroup analyses examine associations (eg, between treatment and outcome) within subsets of a larger study sample. The traditional approach evaluates the data in each of the subgroups independently. More accurate answers, however, may be expected when the rest of the data are considered in the analysis of each subgroup, provided there are 3 or more subgroups. We present a conceptual introduction to subgroup analysis that makes use of all the available data and then illustrate the technique by applying it to a previously published study of pediatric airway management. Using WinBUGS, freely available computer software, we perform an empirical Bayesian analysis of the treatment effect in each of the subgroups. This approach corrects the original subgroup treatment estimates toward a weighted average treatment effect across all subjects. The revised estimates of the subgroup treatment effects demonstrate markedly less variability than the original estimates. Further, using these estimates will reduce our total expected error in parameter estimation compared with using the original, independent subgroup estimates. Although any particular estimate may be adjusted inappropriately, adopting this strategy will, on average, lead to results that are more accurate. When multiple subgroups are considered, it is often inadvisable to ignore the rest of the study data. Authors or readers who wish to examine associations within subgroups are encouraged to use techniques that reduce the total expected error.},

  abstract      = {The problem of identifying to which of a given set of classes objects belong is ubiquitous, occurring in many research domains and application areas, including medical diagnosis, financial decision making, online commerce, and national security. But such assignments are rarely completely perfect, and classification errors occur. This means it is necessary to compare classification methods and algorithms to decide which is ``best'' for any particular problem. However, just as there are many different classification methods, so there are many different ways of measuring their performance. It is thus vital to choose a measure of performance which matches the aims of the research or application. This paper is a contribution to the growing literature on the relative merits of different performance measures. Its particular focus is the critical importance of matching the properties of the measure to the aims for which the classification is being made.},

  abstract  = {For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier.  In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior to logistic calibration for Naive Bayes and Adaboost.},

We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling – a single-parameter variant of Platt Scaling – is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

Our alternative to the traditional construction of posterior probabilities that a given hypothesis is true or that the data originates from a specific model is to consider the models under comparison as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original testing problem with an estimation one that focus on the probability weight of a given model within a mixture model. We analyze the sensitivity on the resulting posterior distribution on the weights of various prior modeling on the weights. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective is that generic improper priors are acceptable, while not putting convergence in jeopardy. Among other features, this allows for a resolution of the Lindley-Jeffreys paradox. When using a reference Beta B(a,a) prior on the mixture weights, we note that the sensitivity of the posterior estimations of the weights to the choice of a vanishes with the sample size increasing and avocate the default choice a=0.5, derived from Rousseau and Mengersen (2011). Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the classical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterior mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are quite similar.},

  abstract      = {A new approach for Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and selection is proposed, based on the mixture model approach for hypothesis testing in Kaniav et al., 2014. Inheriting from the good properties of this approach, it extends BMA to cases where improper priors are chosen for parameters that are common to all candidate models. From an algorithmic point of view, our approach consists in sampling from the posterior distribution of the single-datum mixture of all candidate models, weighted by their prior probabilities. We show that this posterior distribution is equal to the 'Bayesian-model averaged' posterior distribution over all candidate models, weighted by their posterior probability. From this BMA posterior sample, a simple Monte-Carlo estimate of each model's posterior probability is derived, as well as importance sampling estimates for expectations under each model's posterior distribution.},
